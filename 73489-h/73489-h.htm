<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the eleven stories in this book, seven now
appear for the first time. For permission
to reprint “Sir Franklin and the Little
Mothers,” I have to thank Messrs. Bradbury,
Agnew &amp; Co.; and Messrs. George
Allen &amp; Sons allow me to include
“The Miss Bannisters’ Brother.” “The
Monkey’s Revenge” was printed first in
Messrs. Dent’s <i>Christmas Treasury</i>, and “The
Anti-burglars” in <i>The Woman at Home</i> for
December 1902. The motive of the title
story was given to me by Mrs. Charles
Bryant, and that of “The Ring of Fortitude”
by Mrs. W. M. Meredith. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
suggestion as to organs and street cries in
“The Notice-Board” was made to me
by Oxford’s Professor of Poetry. The
autobiographies of coins, I might add, are
a commonplace in old books for children;
but one is at liberty, I think, to adapt the
idea to one’s own time without being
guilty of very serious want of originality.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ANNE’S TERRIBLE GOOD<br>
NATURE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a little girl
named Anne Wilbraham Bayes, Wilbraham
being after her grandfather on the mother’s
side, a very clever gentleman living at
Great Malvern, and writing books on
Roman history, who has, however, nothing
whatever to do with this story. This
story is about Anne and her perfectly
appalling good nature.</p>

<p>Where Anne’s good nature came from
no one ever could guess, for her father had
little enough, always insisting on silence at
breakfast while he read the paper and ate
the biggest egg; and her mother had
little enough, too, never seeing her children
without being reminded of something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
which she wanted from the top left-hand
drawer in her bedroom; while Anne’s
brothers and sisters had so little that they
always forced Anne to be the one who
should go on these boring errands. And
so far as I have been able to discover, none
of Anne’s grandparents were particularly
good-natured either, for old Mr. Bayes
had a barbed-wire fence all round his
estate in west Surrey, near Farnborough,
and old Mrs. Bayes would not allow any
fruit to be picked except by the gardeners;
while old Mr. Wilbraham, in consequence
of writing his Roman history all day long,
insisted on perfect quietness, so that whenever
the children were at Great Malvern
they had to play only at those games with
no noise in them, which are hardly worth
calling games at all; and as for old Mrs.
Wilbraham, she was dead. It looks, therefore,
very much as if Anne either inherited
her wonderful and embarrassing good
nature from a distant ancestor too far back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
to be inquired into, or that it was a totally
new kind, beginning with herself. For
she would do the most dreadful things—things
to make the hair of ordinarily good-natured
people stand on end.</p>

<p>For instance, this is what she did once.
She heard her mother complain to a visitor
one January afternoon that there were no
flowers in the garden at that time of year,
and it made the view from the sitting-room
window very depressing. After lying
awake most of the night thinking how
she might improve this view and make it
more cheerful for her mother’s eyes, Anne
got up very early, while it was still dark,
and went to the conservatory, and chose
from it by candlelight a number of gay
flowers, and these she carefully planted in
the bed just in front of her mother’s
window. It was raining a little, and
bitterly cold, and Anne’s fingers became
numb, and her feet like stones, and her
nose pink, but she went right through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
with it without faltering until the bed was
as gay as summer.</p>

<p>That was good nature, if you like, but
no one seemed to think so. Mrs. Bayes,
when she looked out of the window,
instead of being cheered, screamed out
“Oh!” and sent for her smelling salts,
and then became quite tearful over the
ruin of her pet geraniums, freesias, carnations,
cyclamens, and genistas. Mr.
Bayes was perfectly furious, and said so
several times in different ways, each more
cutting than the last; while Anne’s brothers
and sisters thought it the greatest joke
against Anne possible.</p>

<p>“You didn’t really think they’d live,
did you?” they asked her. “How absolutely
dotty!”</p>

<p>Directly after breakfast the gardener dug
them all up again and put them back in
their hot-house pots. Anne was not
punished for her folly in any other way
than by want of appreciation; but if anyone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
had seen her crying by herself in her
bedroom they might have thought that
she had been.</p>

<p>However, when Valentine’s Day came
round, which was about three weeks later,
and all the little Bayeses found a parcel on
their plates at breakfast—their Aunt
Margaret being one of those few eccentric
persons left who remember St. Valentine’s
Day—Anne’s package was found to be
twice as good as any of the others, containing
as it did not only the ordinary
present, but a gold bangle as well, with a
little piece of blue turquoise hanging from
it (from Liberty’s probably), and this
inscription on a tiny label: “From St.
Valentine to the little girl who tried to
make her mother’s garden bright in winter
and was only laughed at and chidden for
her pains.”</p>

<p>So Anne really scored, you see; but, of
course, it was a ridiculous thing to do,
wasn’t it? Just think of supposing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
hot-house flowers would grow out of doors
in January! It shows how perfectly
absurd Anne’s good nature could be.</p>

<p>That is one case. Now I will tell you
of another.</p>

<p>One day the whole Bayes family were
going to London—they lived near Leatherhead—for
the day. They were going to
Cousin Alice’s wedding in the morning,
and afterwards to the Hippodrome matinée.
Marceline, it is true, was not there any
longer, but it was a wonderful programme,
Mr. Bayes said, and they were all immensely
excited. Besides, they had
bunches of flowers to throw at the bride,
rice having now gone out on account of
its being dangerous for the eyes and very
smartful generally.</p>

<p>The train was full, but Mr. Bayes, by
mentioning the fact overnight, had had a
third-class compartment guarded for him
by a porter, and into this they all climbed:
Mr. Bayes, Mrs. Bayes, Arthur Lloyd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
Bayes, Gerald Gilmer Bayes, Marion Lease
Bayes, Meta Cleghorn Bayes, and Anne
Wilbraham Bayes. There were also two
friends from Leatherhead who knew
Cousin Alice, making nine in all.</p>

<p>Anne sat next the window, on the platform
side.</p>

<p>All went well until the train drew up at
the next station, but there an unfortunate
thing happened. Scores of people were
waiting to get in, and they began to push
round the third-class carriage doors.
Several came to the Bayeses’ compartment,
but, seeing that it was all one family in
their best clothes, they had consideration
and passed on.</p>

<p>Gradually every one found a seat, either
in the thirds or the seconds, and even the
first—all except a poor shabby old woman
in a shawl, with a big basket, who tottered
piteously up and down trying in vain to
find a place. Anne saw her pass and peer
into their carriage with an anxious and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
even tearful look, but Mr. Bayes frowned
so forbiddingly that she hurried on.</p>

<p>At this moment Anne’s terrible good
nature overpowered her, and she leaned
out of the window and cried invitingly:
“Come in here—quick! There’s room
for one.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” said Mr. Bayes; “it’s
full.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Anne—“look! It says,
‘To seat five persons on each side,’ and
we’re only nine altogether. Come in
here,” she cried again to the old woman.</p>

<p>“But she’s dirty,” said Mrs. Bayes;
“she’ll spoil your frocks.”</p>

<p>“Very likely got something catching,”
said Mr. Bayes.</p>

<p>“What a rotter you are, Anne!” said
the others.</p>

<p>But meanwhile a porter had opened the
door and pushed the old woman in. Anne
stood up to give her her place; the others
moved to the other end; and Mr. Bayes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
who, after all, was a very good father and
exceedingly keen about health, let down
the window with a bang and hid behind
his paper.</p>

<p>“I’m sure,” said the old woman to
Anne, “I’m very much obliged to you,
missy.”</p>

<p>She got out at the next station, and as
she did so she handed Anne a little paper
article from her basket, for she was a
pedlar, and said it was a present for her
for being so good-natured; and so saying
she hobbled off, and Mr. Bayes blew hard
through his lips, as if he had come up from
a long dive, and Mrs. Bayes made the
children smell at her salts.</p>

<p>When Anne looked at her present she
found it was a halfpenny row of pins,
and this made every one laugh and quite
happy again. Anne put them in her pocket
and laughed too, although how she could
find it in her heart to laugh, after ruining
the railway journey like that by her unfortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
trick of good nature, I can’t
think.</p>

<p>The wedding was a great success until
Cousin Alice, the bride—and a very pretty
bride too—was coming down the aisle on
Captain Vernon’s arm (and the Captain
looked every inch a soldier, and had across
his forehead the nicest brown line, which
he had brought back with him from Egypt,
where he had been on duty before he hurried
home to marry Cousin Alice); all
went well until a silly boy, in his desire to
cross the church and get to the door first
and begin to throw confetti, stepped on
Cousin Alice’s beautiful white satin train
and tore a yard or two nearly off.</p>

<p>She was as sweet about it as only Cousin
Alice could be, but she stopped and picked
it up, and looked round imploringly for
help. And then happened that which I
need hardly tell you, for you have guessed
it already. The only person that had any
pins was Anne, who stepped out of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
pew and handed her little halfpenny row
to Captain Vernon; and there and then,
several people helping, the beautiful white
satin train was made all right again, at
least for the time being, and the bride and
bridegroom walked on, smiling to right
and left, and ducked their heads outside as
the flowers and confetti rained on them,
and got into the brougham, and the coach-man
cracked his whip with the white
rosette on it, and they were driven to
Uncle Maurice’s house, where Cousin
Alice used to live, but where she would
now live no more.</p>

<p>After a while the Bayes family, with
many other guests, arrived there too, to
stay for a few minutes to see the presents
and say good-bye to the bride. It was a
morning wedding, because they were going
on a very long journey.</p>

<p>When Anne came at last face to face with
Cousin Alice and Captain Vernon, Captain
Vernon, who had suddenly become Cousin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
Phil, took out of his pocket a piece of
money, and, holding it tight in his hand,
said to Anne: “I owe you this.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Anne, “you don’t. How
could you?”</p>

<p>“How could I?” said Cousin Phil.
“Why, I bought a row of pins from you
this morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh no!” said Anne again. “I was
very glad to have them for Cousin Alice
to use.”</p>

<p>“You may say what you like, Anne,”
said Cousin Phil, “but I consider that you
sold them to me, and I intend to pay for
them; and here you are, and you shall give
me a receipt for it.” And so saying, he
stooped down, and Anne kissed him, and
he kissed Anne; and then Cousin Alice
kissed Anne and Anne kissed Cousin Alice;
and then other people pressed forward and
Anne walked away. And when she looked
at the piece of money in her hand it was
a sovereign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>All’s well that ends well, says Shakespeare,
but of course it was very unwise
and very unnecessary of Anne to have leaned
out of the window of that nice clean
family compartment and invited into it a
dirty old pedlar woman, even if she was
very infirm and unhappy and there was
no room anywhere else. We must, as
Mr. Bayes remarked on the way home—his
words not very clear by reason of his
eating all the time one of the chocolate
creams which Anne had bought with part
of her sovereign for the family at the
Hippodrome. “We must,” said Mr.
Bayes—and the others all agreed with
him—“we must, dear Anne, be a little
careful how we exercise even so amiable
a quality as kindness of heart. I am very
glad to see you always so ready to be
nice and helpful to others, but your
brain has been given you to a large extent
to control your impulses. Never forget
that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>Here Mr. Bayes took another chocolate,
and very soon afterwards their station was
reached.</p>

<p>But did Anne profit by her father’s
excellent advice? We shall soon see, for
now I come to the worst adventure into
which her terrible good nature has ever
led her.</p>

<p>You must know that the Bayeses were
not rich, although they had rich relations
and really never wanted for anything.
But they lived on as little as possible, and
on two or three mornings every week
Mr. Bayes, after reading his letters, would
remark that all his investments were going
wrong and they would soon be in the
workhouse. That was, of course, only
his way; but they could not have many
treats, or many visitors, and it caused
them to look with very longing eyes on
the young Calderons, the children of the
gentleman that had taken the Hall, the
great house near by, for August and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
September, who used to gallop by on
their ponies, and play golf and cricket in
their park, and who never seemed to want
for anything.</p>

<p>To know the Calderon family was the
Bayeses’ great desire, but their mother
explained that it would not be right to
call on strangers staying for so short a
time, and nothing therefore could be done:
which was particularly trying because,
owing to the absence of something called
dividends, the visit to Sea View, said
Mr. Bayes, was this year an impossibility.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs on the
morning of August 21, when Anne was
working in her garden just under the wall
which separated Mr. Bayes’s property
from the high road. She was steadily
pulling up weeds after the rain, and
thinking how nice the sun made the earth
smell, when she heard the beating of hoofs,
and the scrunching of wheels on the road,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
and a murmur of happy voices young and
old. And then she heard a man’s voice
call out “Stop!” and the horses were
pulled up.</p>

<p>“What is it, father?” she heard a girl’s
voice say.</p>

<p>And then the man’s voice replied, “We
shall have to go back. I’ve just remembered
that no cups and saucers were
put in.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, don’t let’s go back,” said one
child’s voice after another. “It’s so hot,
and it doesn’t really matter. We can
drink out of the glasses.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the father’s voice again,
“we must go back. You forget that the
Richardsons are going to meet us there,
and they will want tea and want it
properly served. We must have at least
six cups and saucers. Turn round, John!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_019_facing">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_019_facing.jpg" alt="PLEASE DON’T TROUBLE TO GO BACK">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“PLEASE DON’T TROUBLE TO GO BACK. I’LL LEND YOU THE
CUPS AND SAUCERS.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By this time, Anne, who had been struggling
to set a ladder against the wall, had
got it to stand still and climbed to the top,
and just as John began to turn the horses
of the carriage she called out:</p>

<p>“Please don’t trouble to go back. I’ll
lend you the cups and saucers. I won’t
be gone a minute”; and before anyone
could reply she was down the ladder and
running to the house.</p>

<p>Perhaps if she had not been in such a
hurry, and had not been so genuinely
troubled to think of the picnic party
spoiling their pleasure by going back to
the Hall (a horrid thing to do, as Anne
remembered, after leaving it so gaily), she
would have asked herself several questions—such
as, “What right have I to offer to
lend strangers cups and saucers belonging
to my parents?” and “Is my head properly
controlling my impulse?” and so forth. But
Anne had no time for inquiries like that:
all she could think of was getting the cups
and saucers as soon as possible, and returning
with them so as to save those nice
picnic people from having to go back again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>Just before she reached the house, however,
she remembered that old Martha,
the cook, was in a very bad temper
that morning, and would certainly refuse
to give them up; but Anne also remembered
at the same instant that there was
in the drawing-room a cabinet full of
cups and saucers, which no one ever used,
but which now and then a visitor took
out and examined underneath, and she
decided to take six of these instead—so
hastily seizing a basket from a hook in
the hall she took what she wanted from
the cabinet and ran back panting to the
gate leading to the road.</p>

<p>To her immense delight the carriage
was still standing there, and she hastened
to hand the basket to the gentleman who
was waiting in the road to receive it.</p>

<p>“Well, you are a little brick,” he said,
“and how hot it has made you.”</p>

<p>Anne gasped out something in reply, but
not at all comfortably, because for one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
thing she was out of breath, and for
another the children in the carriage were
all looking at her very hard. But at this
moment the gentleman, who had been
examining the basket, gave a low whistle
and then called to one of the ladies to
come and speak to him. She got out of
the carriage and walked a little way apart
with the gentleman, who showed her
something in the basket and talked very
earnestly. Then all of a sudden he called
to the children to get out and play for a
little while until he and their mother
came back, and taking Anne’s hand he
asked her if she would lead him and
his wife to her mother, as he had something
to say to her, and they all three
went off through the gate to the house.</p>

<p>The gentleman talked gaily as they
went, and the lady held Anne’s other hand
very softly, and so they came to Mr.
Bayes’s study, where he was writing, Mrs.
Bayes and the other children being in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Leatherhead shopping. The gentleman
and Mr. Bayes then talked together, while
Anne led the lady about the garden until
she was suddenly sent for to change her
clothes—why, you shall hear.</p>

<p>What happened at the interview between
Mr. Bayes and the gentleman can best be
told by repeating the conversation between
Mr. and Mrs. Bayes and the children at
lunch.</p>

<p>“But where’s Anne?” said Mrs. Bayes,
as the servant removed the cover from the
joint.</p>

<p>“Anne,” said Mr. Bayes, “Anne? Oh,
yes, Anne has gone for a picnic.”</p>

<p>“For a picnic!” cried the whole
family.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Bayes, “for a picnic
with the people staying at the Hall.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bayes sat back with a gasp, and
the children’s mouths opened so wide you
could have posted letters in them.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Bayes. “She was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
working in her garden when she heard
Mr. Calderon order the driver to go back
because cups and saucers had been forgotten.
He is a very nice fellow, by the
way. I find we were at Oxford together,
although I did not know him there, but he
has been intimate with Charley for years. It
is the same Calderon, the architect, that
built your uncle’s house at Chichester.”</p>

<p>“Do go on, father,” said the children.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Bayes, “what does
that little duffing Anne do but sing out that
they were not to go back, but wait a
minute, and she would lend them the cups
and saucers.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, go on!”</p>

<p>“Well, and fearing that Martha—very
properly—wouldn’t let her have any for
the party, what does she do but take six of
the very best of my Crown Derby from
the cabinet in the drawing-room and
scamper back with them!”</p>

<p>“My love,” said Mrs. Bayes, “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
Crown Derby that Uncle Mortimer left
us?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the Crown Derby, valued only a
month ago at two guineas apiece. Off
she runs with it in a basket and hands it
over to Mr. or Mrs. Calderon. Mrs.
Calderon, by the way, I like. She wants
you to call. I said you’d go to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Do go on, father!”</p>

<p>“Well, where was I? Oh yes. The
Calderons no sooner saw the china than
they realized what had happened, and
brought it back to me. By a miracle
there wasn’t a chip on it. Of course, I
said I was very much obliged to them, and
I offered some ordinary crockery, but
Calderon said they would take it only on
condition that Anne accompanied it in the
capacity of caretaker and brought it back.
So she went.”</p>

<p>“I hope she changed her frock,” said
Mrs. Bayes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>“I believe she did,” said Mr. Bayes.
“They’ve gone to Chidley Woods, where
the Richardsons will meet them, and they
won’t be back till six. Now perhaps I
may get on with my lunch.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>By the following Saturday evening, I
may add, the Bayes children and the
Calderon children were very friendly, and
Arthur Lloyd Bayes had fallen off Harold
Armiger Calderon’s pony twice.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE">THE<br>
THOUSAND THREEPENNY BITS</h2>
</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a little girl
named Alison Muirhead, and she had a
doll named Rosamund and a dog named
Thomson. The dog was an Aberdeen
terrier, and he came from Aberdeen by
train in the care of the guard, and he rarely
did what he was told, which is the way of
Aberdeens, as you have perhaps discovered.</p>

<p>Alison used to take her doll and Thomson
every day into Kensington Gardens,
and when they were well inside the
Gardens, opposite the tulips and the new
statue of William III., she used to unclasp
the catch of Thomson’s lead and let him
run, doing her best to keep an eye on him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
This was not easy, for Thomson was a
sociable dog, and he rushed after every
other dog he saw, and either told them the
latest dog joke or heard it, and Alison was
often in despair to get him back.</p>

<p>If, however, Thomson had been an
angel of a dog this story would never have
been written, because it was wholly owing
to his naughtiness that Alison and the Old
Gentleman met.</p>

<p>The Old Gentleman used also to go
into the Gardens on every fine day and sit
on one of the seats by the may-trees between
the long bulb walk and the Round
Pond, with his back to the Albert
Memorial. Not that he was one of those
persons who always click their tongues
when the Albert Memorial is mentioned,
for, as a matter of fact, he did not mind
the gold on it at all, and he really liked
the groups of Asia and Europe and India
at the corners, with the nice friendly
elephant and camel in them; but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
turned his back on the Memorial because
the seat was set that way, and he liked also,
when he raised his eyes from his book, to
see so much green grass, and in the distance
the yachtsmen running round the Round
Pond to prevent their vessels wrecking
themselves on the cement.</p>

<p>Alison had noticed the Old Gentleman
for a long time before they had become
acquainted, and he had noticed her, and
was much attracted by her quiet little ways
with Rosamund, and her calm, if despairing,
pursuit of Thomson; and he liked her,
too, for never playing diabolo.</p>

<p>But it was not until one day that Thomson
broke loose at the very gate of the
Gardens with his lead still on him, and in
course of time ran right under the Old
Gentleman’s legs and caught the chain in
one of the eyelet flaps of his laced boots,
that Alison and he came to speak.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha!” said the Old Gentleman to
Thomson, “I’ve got you now. And I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
shall hold you tight till your mistress
comes.”</p>

<p>Alison was still a long way off. Thomson
said nothing, but tugged at the
chain.</p>

<p>“I’ve been watching you for a long
time, Mr. Thomson,” said the Old Gentleman,
“and I have come to the conclusion
that you are a bad dog. You don’t care
for anyone. You do what you want to
do and nothing else.” Thomson lay down
and put out a yard and a half of pink
tongue. Alison came nearer.</p>

<p>“If you were my dog,” the Old Gentleman
continued, “do you know what I
should do? I should thrash you.” Thomson
began to snore.</p>

<p>Alison at this point came up, and
Thomson sprang to his feet and affected
to be pleased to see her.</p>

<p>“Thank you ever so much,” Alison
said to the Old Gentleman. “But however
did you catch him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“I didn’t catch him,” said the Old
Gentleman, “he caught me. Come and
sit down and rest yourself.”</p>

<p>So Alison sat down, and Thomson laid
his wicked cheek against her boot, and
that was the beginning of the acquaintance.</p>

<p>The next day when she went into the
Gardens Alison looked for the Old Gentleman,
and sure enough there he was, and
seeing there was no one beside him, she
sat down there again. And for a little
while on every fine day she sat with him
and they talked of various things. He
was very interesting: he knew a great
deal about birds and flowers and foreign
countries. He had not only lived in
China, but had explored the Amazon.
On his watch chain was a blue stone
which an Indian snake-charmer had given
him. But he lived now in the big hotel
at the corner of the Gardens and all his
wanderings were over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>The funniest thing about him was his
name. Alison did not learn what it was
for a long time, but one day as she
was calling “Thomson! Thomson!” very
loudly as they sat there, the Old Gentleman
said, “When you do that it makes
me nervous.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Alison asked.</p>

<p>“Because,” the Old Gentleman said,
“my name’s Thomson too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so sorry,” Alison said, “I
must call Thomson—I mean my dog—something
else. I can’t ever call him
Thomson again.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” said the Old Gentleman.
“It doesn’t matter at all. I can’t expect
to be the only Thomson in the world.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” said Alison, “I shall.”</p>

<p>The next day the first thing she did
when she saw the Old Gentleman was to
tell him she had changed Thom—the
dog’s name. “In future,” she said, “he
is to be called Jimmie.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>The Old Gentleman laughed. “That’s
my name too,” he said.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>One day the Old Gentleman was not
in his accustomed place; and it was a
very fine day too. Alison was disappointed,
and even Thomson, I mean Jimmie, I
mean the Aberdeen terrier, seemed to
miss something.</p>

<p>And the next day he was not there.</p>

<p>And the next.</p>

<p>And then came Sunday, when Alison
went to church, and afterwards for a rather
dull walk with her father, strictly on the
paths, past “Physical Energy” to the
Serpentine, to look at the peacocks, and
then back again by the Albert Memorial,
and so home. Monday and Tuesday were
both wet, and on Wednesday it was a
whole week since Alison had seen the Old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Gentleman; but to her grief he was again
absent.</p>

<p>And so, having her mother’s permission,
the next day she called at the hotel. She
had the greatest difficulty in getting in
because it was the first time that either
she or her dog had ever been through a
revolving door; but at last they came
safely into the hall into the presence of a
tall porter in a uniform of splendour.</p>

<p>“Can you tell me if Mr. James Thomson
is still staying here?” Alison asked.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say, Missie,” replied the
porter, “that Mr. Thomson died last
week.”</p>

<p>Poor Alison....</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>One morning, some few weeks afterwards,
Alison found on her plate a letter
addressed to herself in a strange handwriting.
After wondering about it for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
some moments, she opened it. The letter
ran thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="indentleft2">“<i>Re Mr. James Thomson, deceased.</i></span><br>
<br>
<span class="indentleft2">“<span class="smcap">To Miss Alison Muirhead.</span></span><br>
<span class="indentleft">“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</span></p>

<p><span class="indentleft3">“We beg to inform you that, in</span>
accordance with the last will and testament
of our client, the late Mr. James
Thomson, there lies at our office a packet
containing a thousand threepenny bits,
being a legacy which he devised to yourself,
free of duty, in a codicil added a few
days before his death. We should state
that, by the terms of the bequest, it was
our client’s wish that five hundred of the
threepenny bits should be spent by you for
others within a year of its receipt, and not
put away against a maturer age; the remaining
five hundred he wished to be spent
by yourself, for yourself, and for yourself
alone, also within the year. The parcel is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
at your service whenever it is convenient
to you to call for it.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright2">“We are, dear madam,</span><br>
<span class="indentright">“Yours faithfully,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Lee, Lee and Lee</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>Alison was too bewildered to take it all
in on the first reading, and her father
therefore read it again and explained some
of the words, which perhaps your father
will do for you.</p>

<p>But if Alison was bewildered, it was
nothing to her mother’s state, which was
one of amazement and pride too.</p>

<p>“To think of it!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Well, I never heard of such a thing
in my life!” she said.</p>

<p>“It’s like something in a book or a
play!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“A thousand threepenny bits! Why,
that’s—let me see—yes, it’s—why, it’s
twelve pounds ten,” she remarked.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Muirhead, he was pleased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
too; but him it seemed to amuse more
than surprise.</p>

<p>“After your lessons this morning,” he
said, “instead of going for a walk you
can come into the city to me, and we’ll
go to the lawyers’ together, and then have
lunch at Birch’s.”</p>

<p>When they reached the lawyers’ office
Alison and her father were shown into a
large room with three grave gentlemen in
it, whom Alison supposed were Lee, Lee
and Lee; and all the time that her
father was talking to them she wondered
which was <i>the</i> Lee, and which was the
second Lee, and which was “and Lee.”
Then she had to sign a paper, and then
one of the Lees gave her a canvas bag
containing a thousand threepenny bits.</p>

<p>“Of course you would like to count
them,” he said; and Alison replied, “Yes,”
at which every one laughed, because Mr.
Lee had meant it for a joke and Alison
had taken it seriously. But how could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
she expect that Mr. Thomson’s lawyer,
or, indeed, any lawyer of a dead friend,
would make a joke?</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” said Mr. Lee, when they
had done laughing “that you would be
very tired of the job before you were half-way
through it. Count them when you
get home, and if there is any mistake we
will put it right; but one of our most
careful clerks has already gone through
them very thoroughly.”</p>

<p>Then they all shook hands, and each of
the three Lees said something playful.</p>

<p>The one that Alison guessed was Lee
said, “Don’t be extravagant and buy the
moon.”</p>

<p>The one that Alison guessed was the
second Lee said, “If at any time you get
tired of so much money, we shall be
pleased to have it again.”</p>

<p>While “and Lee” looked very solemn
and said, “Now you can go to church a
thousand times.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>Then they all laughed again, and Alison
and her father were shown out into the
street by a little sharp boy, whose eyes
were fixed so keenly on the canvas bag
that Alison was quite certain that he was
the most careful clerk who had done the
counting.</p>

<p>After they had been to lunch at Birch’s,
where they had mock turtle soup and
oyster patties, they went home, and Alison
poured all the threepenny bits into a depression
in a cushion from the sofa, and
counted them into a hundred piles of ten
each. Then she got a wooden writing-desk,
which had been given her by her
grandmother, and emptied out all the
treasures it contained, and put fifty of the
little heaps into the large part of the
writing-case, and the remaining fifty little
heaps into the compartment for pens and
sealing-wax, and locked it up again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>For the next few days Alison collected
advice about the spending of her money
from every one she knew. All her friends
were asked to give their opinions, and
thus gradually she decided upon the best
way to spend the five hundred threepenny
bits which were for others.</p>

<p>Her first thought was naturally for her
mother, who was an invalid. Mrs. Muirhead
was very fond of flowers, and so
Alison went at once to see the old flower-woman
who sits outside Kensington High
Street Station, and who was so cross with
the Suffragettes in self-denial week for
interfering with her “pitch,” as she called
it; and Alison arranged with her for a
threepenny bunch of whatever was in
season to be taken to her mother twice
every week, on Saturdays and Wednesdays,
for a year, and, to the old woman’s intense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
astonishment, she gave her one hundred
and four of her threepenny bits.</p>

<p>Her uncle Mordaunt advised her to take
in a weekly illustrated paper—say the
<i>Sphere</i>—and, after she had looked at it herself,
to send it to one of the lighthouses,
where the men are very lonely and unentertained.
Alison thought this was a very
good idea. The <i>Sphere</i> cost two threepences
a week, and postage a halfpenny, or
one hundred and twelve threepences—altogether
one pound eight shillings.</p>

<p>Alison had now spent two hundred
and sixteen threepenny bits, and, having
arranged these two things, she decided to
wait till Christmas came nearer (it was
now July) before she spent any more large
sums, always, however, keeping a few
threepenny bits handy in her purse in case
of meeting any particularly hard case, such
as a very blind man, or a begging mother
with a dreadfully cold little baby, or a
Punch and Judy man with a really nice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
face, or a little boy who had fallen down
and hurt himself badly, or an old woman
who ought to be riding in a ’bus. In this
way she got rid of fifty of her little coins
before Christmas came near enough for
her once more to think of little else but
threepenny plans.</p>

<p>It was then that she found Tommy
Cathcart so useful. Tommy Cathcart was
one of her father’s articled pupils, and it
was he who reminded Alison of the claims
of sandwichmen. Sandwichmen have an
awfully bad time, Tommy explained to
her. It is almost the last thing men do.
No one carries sandwich-boards until he
has failed in every other way.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_044_facing">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_044_facing.jpg" alt="THESE TOMMY CATHCART AND SHE SLIPPED INTO THE HANDS
OF THE SANDWICH-MEN.">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">THESE TOMMY CATHCART AND SHE SLIPPED INTO THE HANDS
OF THE SANDWICH-MEN.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After talking it over very seriously,
they went together to a tobacconist near
the Strand, who undertook to make up
thirty little packets for threepence each,
containing a clay pipe and tobacco, and
these Tommy Cathcart and she slipped
into the hands of the sandwichmen as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>they drifted by in Regent Street, in the
Strand, and in Oxford Street, while the
rest were given to a little group of the
men who were resting, with their sandwich-boards
leaned against the wall, in a
court near Shaftesbury Avenue.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think,” Alison said, “that
those who carry a notice over the head
as well ought to have more?”</p>

<p>But Tommy Cathcart thought not.</p>

<p>That exhausted seven-and-sixpence.</p>

<p>Another thing that Alison and Tommy
Cathcart did was to knock at the door of
the cabmen’s shelter opposite De Vere
Gardens, and ask if she might present a few
puddings for Christmas Day. The man
said she might, and that used up seven-and-sixpence—three
puddings at half a
crown, thirty threepences.</p>

<p>The other people to whom Alison sent
Christmas presents with Mr. Thomson’s
money were the children of the boatmen
who had taken out her and her father and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
her cousins, Harry and Francis Frend, in
the Isle of Wight last year. These boatmen
were two brothers named Fagg—Jack
and Willy Fagg—and their boat was the
<i>Seamew</i>. Jack had four children and
Willy six, and Alison used to go and see
them now and then. After much consideration
she sent four threepenny bits
to each of these children, a shilling pipe,
with real silver on it, to Jack and Willy,
and a pound of two-shilling tea to Mrs.
Jack and Mrs. Willy. That made sixteen
shillings, or sixty-four threepenny bits.</p>

<p>Just then Alison had an unexpected piece
of luck, for as she was passing a shop in
Westbourne Grove she saw a window full
of mittens at threepence a pair, sale price.
Now, mittens are just the thing for cabmen
in winter—cabmen and crossing-sweepers
and errand-boys. So Alison
bought thirty pairs, or seven-and-sixpence
worth, and she gave a pair to each of the
boys that called regularly—the butcher’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
boy, and the baker’s boy, and the grocer’s
boy, and a pair to the milkman, and a pair
to the crossing-sweeper, and the rest were
put in the hall for cabmen who brought
her father home or took him out.</p>

<p>And then, just as they were getting
rather in despair, one afternoon Tommy
Cathcart came home with a brilliant idea.</p>

<p>“Smith,” he said, “is the commonest
name in England. In every workhouse in
England,” he said, “there must be one
Smith at least. Why not,” he said, “get,
say, sixty picture postcards and send them
addressed to Mrs. Smith or Mr. Smith, or
plain Smith, to sixty workhouses? We can
get,” he said, “the names from ‘Bradshaw.’
A person in a workhouse will be
awfully excited to get a Christmas card,
and if,” he said, “there happens to be no
Smith, some one else will have it.”</p>

<p>Alison liked the idea very much, and so
they went off to a shop in the Strand
absolutely full of picture postcards and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
bought sixty at a penny each. They had
some little difficulty in choosing, because
Tommy Cathcart wanted a certain number
to be photographs of Pauline Chase and
other pretty people, but Alison said that
views of London would be better, since
most persons knew London, and the card
would remind them of old times. As it
was, so to speak, her money, Alison got
her own way. Then they bought sixty
halfpenny stamps, and returned home to
find the towns in “Bradshaw” and send
them off. That all came to seven-and-six,
or thirty threepenny bits.</p>

<p>Then Alison had a very brilliant inspiration—to
give Jimmie a beautiful silver
collar all for himself, with the words “In
memory of James Thomson” on it, as a
Christmas present. Dogs have so few
presents, and Jimmie really was very good,
except when he lost his head in the
Gardens, which indeed, to be truthful, he
always did. So he had his collar on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
Christmas morning, and it cost exactly
twelve-and-six altogether, or fifty threepenny
bits.</p>

<p>So much for the first five hundred.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Alison had then to lay out the second
five hundred, or £6 5s., on herself and
herself alone. This was easier. She and
her father spent three afternoons among
the old furniture shops of Kensington and
the Brompton Road, and at last came upon
the very thing they were looking for in
the back room of a shop close to the
Oratory, kept by an elderly Jewish lady
with a perfectly gigantic nose and rings
on every finger.</p>

<p>This was an old bureau writing-desk,
with drawers, and a flap to pull down to
write on, and lots of pigeon-holes, and a
very strong lock. Also a secret drawer.
After some bargaining Mr. Muirhead got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
it for six pounds, which left five shillings
for writing paper and sealing-wax and
blotting-paper and nibs.</p>

<p>And that was an end of the thousand
threepenny bits, as the balance-sheet on
the opposite page shows.</p>

<p>At least, not quite the end, as I will
tell you. The face of the old Jewess,
when the time came to pay for the bureau
and Alison took forty-eight little packets
of ten threepenny bits each out of her bag
and laid them on the table, was a picture
of perplexity and amusement.</p>

<p>“Well, ma tear, what’s that?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“Four hundred and eighty threepenny bits—six
pounds,” said Alison.</p>

<p>“But, ma tear, what will I do with all
the little money?”</p>

<p>“It’s all I’ve got,” said Alison.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Mr. Muirhead—and
then he told the old lady with the big
nose the story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>And what do you think she did?
“Well, ma tear,” she said, “I can’t let
you go away without something left, in
case you met a poor beggar in the street.
You must take back one of those little
packets to go on with, as a present from
me;” and she picked up one and placed it
in Alison’s hand, and Alison took it gladly.</p>

<p>And that was the beginning of a new
Threepenny Trust, for Mr. Cathcart also
contributed a little heap, and Mr. Muirhead
henceforward made a point of saving
every threepenny bit that he received in
change (and I believe that sometimes he
asked specially for them when he went to
his bank) and bringing them home for
Alison’s fund; and Uncle Mordaunt must
have done the same, for the last time he
came to dinner he said to Alison, “I
wish you’d get rid of this rubbish for
me,” and handed her seventeen of the
little coins.</p>

<p>So you see that there is every chance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
Mr. James Thomson’s kind scheme going
on for a long time yet; but, in so far as his
own thousand threepenny bits are concerned,
the story is done.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">RODERICK’S PROS.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a little boy
of ten, who bowled out C. B. Fry. This
little boy’s name was Roderick Bulstrode
(or Bulstrode is the name that we will give
him here), and he lived in St. John’s
Wood, in one of the houses whose gardens
join Lord’s. His father played for the
M.C.C. a good deal, and practised in the
nets almost every day, to the bowling of
various professionals, or pros., as they are
called for short, but chiefly to that of
Tom Stick; and in the summer Roderick
was more often at Lord’s than not.</p>

<p>How it came about that Roderick
bowled C. B. Fry was this way. Middlesex
were playing Sussex, and Mr. Fry
went to the nets early to practise, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
Roderick’s father bowled to him and let
Roderick have the ball now and then. And
whether it was that Mr. Fry was not
thinking, or was looking another way, or
was simply very good-natured, I don’t
know, but one of Roderick’s sneaks got
under his bat and hit the stumps. (They
were not sneaks, you must understand,
because he wanted to bowl sneaks, but
because he was not big enough to bowl
any other way for 22 yards. He was
only ten.) Roderick thus did that day
what no one else could do, for Mr. Fry
went in and made 143 not out, in spite
of all the efforts of Albert Trott and
Tarrant and J. T. Hearne.</p>

<p>Roderick’s bedroom walls had been
covered with portraits of cricketers for
years, but after he bowled out C. B. Fry
he took away a lot of them and made an
open space with the last picture postcard
of Mr. Fry right in the middle of it, and
underneath, on the mantelpiece, he put the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
ball he had bowled him with, which his
father gave him, under a glass shade. And
other little St. John’s Wood boys, friends
of Roderick’s from the Abbey Road, and
Hamilton Terrace, and Loudoun Road, and
that very attractive red-brick village with
a green of its own just off the Avenue
Road, used to come and see it, and stand
in front of it and hold their breath, rather
like little girls looking at a new baby.</p>

<p>Roderick also had a “Cricketers’ Birthday
Book,” so that when he came down to
breakfast he used to say, “Tyldesley’s
thirty-five to-day,” “Hutchings is twenty-four,”
and so on. And he knew the
initials of every first-class amateur and the
Christian name of every pro.</p>

<p>That was not Roderick’s only cricketing
triumph. It is true that he had never
succeeded in bowling out any other really
swell batsman, but he had shaken hands
with Sammy Woods and J. R. Mason, and
one day Lord Hawke took him by both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
shoulders and lifted him to one side, saying:
“Now then, Tommy, out of the
way.” But these were only chance acquaintances.
His real cricketing friend
was Tom Stick, the ground bowler.</p>

<p>Tom Stick came from Devonshire,
which is a county without a first-class
eleven that plays the M.C.C. in August,
and he lived in a little street off Lisson
Grove, where he kept a bird-fancier’s shop.
For most professional cricketers, you know,
are something else as well, or they would
not be able to live in the winter. Many
of them make cricket-bats, many keep
inns, many are gardeners. I know one
who is a picture-framer, and another an
organist, while George Hirst, who is the
greatest of them all, makes toffee. Well,
Tom Stick was a bird-fancier, with a
partner named Dick Crawley, who used
to mind the shop when Tom had to be at
Lord’s bowling to gentlemen, Roderick’s
father among them, or playing against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Haileybury or Rugby or wherever he was
sent to do all the hard work and go in
last.</p>

<p>Roderick’s father was very fond of Tom
and was quite happy to know that Roderick
was with him, so that Roderick not only
used to join Tom at Lord’s, but also at the
shop off Lisson Grove, where he often
helped in cleaning out the cages and feeding
the birds and teaching the bullfinches
to whistle, and was very good friends also
with certain puppies and rabbits. His
own dog, a fox-terrier named “Sinhji,”
had come from Tom.</p>

<p>Tom used to bowl to Roderick in the
mornings before the gentlemen arrived for
their practice, and he taught him to hold
his bat straight and not slope it, and to
keep his feet still and not draw them away
when the ball was coming (which are the
two most important things in batting),
and it was he who stopped Roderick from
carrying an autograph-book about and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
worrying the cricketers for their signatures.
In fact, Tom was a kind of nurse
to Roderick, and they were so much together
that, whereas Tom was known to
Roderick’s small friends as “Roddy’s Pro,”
Roderick was known to Tom’s friends as
“Sticky’s Shadow.”</p>

<p>Now it happened that last summer
Roderick’s father had been making a great
many runs for the M.C.C. in one of their
tours. (Roderick did not see him, for he
had to stay at home and do his lessons;
but his father sent him a telegram after
each innings.) Mr. Bulstrode (as we are
calling him) batted so well, indeed, that
when he returned to London he was asked
to play for Middlesex against Yorkshire
on the following Monday, to take the
place of one of the regular eleven who
was ill; and you may be sure he said
yes, for, although he was now thirty-two,
this was the first time he had ever been
asked to play for his county.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>Roderick, you may be equally sure, was
also pleased; and when his father suddenly
said to him, “Would you like to come
with me?” his excitement was almost too
great to bear.</p>

<p>“And Tom too?” he asked, after a
minute or so.</p>

<p>“Yes, Tom’s going,” said his father.
“He’s going to field if anyone is hurt or
has to leave early. But if he’s not wanted
he will look after you.”</p>

<p>“Hurray!” said Roderick. “I know
what I shall do. I shall score every run
and keep the bowling analysis too.”</p>

<p>The train left St. Pancras on the Sunday
afternoon, and that in itself was an excitement,
for Roderick had never travelled on
Sunday before; but before that had come
the rapture of packing his bag, which on
this occasion was not an ordinary one, but
an old cricket-bag of his father’s, which
he begged for, in which were not only his
sponge and collars and other necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
things, but his flannels and his bat and
pads.</p>

<p>This bag he insisted upon carrying himself
all along the platform, and, as several
of the Middlesex team were also on their
way to the train at the same moment, the
presence of so small a cricketer in their
midst made a great sensation among the
porters.</p>

<p>“My word!” said one, “Yorkshire will
have to look out this time.”</p>

<p>“Who’s the giant,” asked another,
“walking just behind Albert Trott? I
shouldn’t like to be in when he bowled his
fastest.”</p>

<p>But Roderick was unconscious of any
laughter. He was the proudest boy in
London, although his arm, it is true, was
beginning to ache horribly. But when,
as he was climbing into the carriage, the
guard lifted him up and called him
“Prince Run-get-simply,” he joined in
the fun.</p>

SENSATION AMONG THE PORTERS.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>It was a deliriously happy journey, for
all the cricketers were very nice to him,
and Mr. Warner talked about Australia,
and Mr. Bosanquet showed him how he
held the ball to make it break from the
leg when the batsman thought it was
going to break from the off, and at
Nottingham Mr. Douglas bought him a
bun and a banana. They got to Sheffield
just before eight, and Roderick went to
bed very soon after, in a little bed in his
father’s room in the hotel.</p>

<p>The first thing Roderick did the next
morning was to buy a scoring-book and a
pencil, and then he and his father explored
Sheffield a little before it was time to go
to the ground at Bramall Lane and get
some practice.</p>

<p>The people clustered all round and in
front of the nets and watched the batsmen,
and now and then they were nearly killed,
as always happens before a match. They
pointed out the cricketers to each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“There’s Warner,” they said. “That’s
Bosanquet—the tall one.” “Where’s
Trott? Why, there, bowling at Warner.
Good old Alberto!” and so on.</p>

<p>“Who’s the man in the end net?”
Roderick heard some one ask.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. One of Middlesex’s
many new men, I suppose,” said the other.</p>

<p>“But he can hit a bit, can’t he?” the
first man said, as Roderick’s father stepped
out to a ball and banged it half-way across
the ground.</p>

<p>Roderick was very proud, and he felt
that the time had come to make his
father known. “That’s Bulstrode,” he
said.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s Bulstrode, is it?” said the
second man. “I’ve heard of him. He
makes lots of runs on the M.C.C. tours.
But I guess Georgy’ll get him.”</p>

<p>“Who is Georgy?” asked Roderick.</p>

<p>“Georgy—why, where do you come
from? Fancy being in Sheffield and asking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
who Georgy is. Georgy is Georgy
Hirst, of course.”</p>

<p>Roderick walked back to the pavilion
with his father very proudly. “You’ll
have to be very careful how you play
Hirst,” he said.</p>

<p>“I shall,” said his father; “but why?”</p>

<p>“Because the men were saying he’s
going to get you.” Mr. Bulstrode
laughed; but he thought it very likely
too.</p>

<p>I’m not going to tell you all about the
match, for it lasted three days, and was
very much like other matches. Roderick
had a corner seat in the pavilion, where he
could see everything, and for the first day
he scored every run and kept the analysis
right through. This included his father’s
innings, which lasted, alas! far too short
a time, for, after making four good hits to
the boundary, he was caught close in at
what was called silly mid-on off—what
bowler do you think?—George Hirst.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>But the next day Roderick gave up
work, because he wanted to see more of
Tom, and Tom made room for him in the
professionals’ box while Yorkshire were in,
and he saw all the wonderful men—quite
close too—Tunnicliffe and Denton and
Hirst—and even talked with them. Hirst
sat right in front of the box, with his
brown sunburned arms on the ledge, and
his square, jolly, sunburned face on his
arms, and said funny things about the
play in broad Yorkshire; and now and
then he would say something to Roderick.
And then suddenly down went a wicket,
and Hirst got up to go in.</p>

<p>“Give me a wish for luck,” he said to
Roddy.</p>

<p>“I wish my father may catch you out,”
said Roddy; “but not until,” he added,
“you have made a lot of runs.”</p>

<p>“If he does,” said Hirst, “I’ll give
thee some practice to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>Poor Roddy, this was almost too much.
It is bad enough to watch your favourites
batting at any time, for every ball may be
the last; but it is terrible when you
equally want two people to bring something
off—for Roddy wanted Hirst (whom
he now adored) to make a good innings,
and, at the same time, he wanted his
father to catch Hirst out.</p>

<p>Hirst was not out when it was time for
lunch, and so Roderick was able to tell
his father all about it.</p>

<p>“What’s this, Hirst?” said Mr. Bulstrode,
when the teams were being photographed.
“Give me a chance, and let
me see if I can hold it.”</p>

<p>Hirst laughed, and when he laughs it is
like a sunset in fine weather. “I have a
spy round to see where thee’re standing
every over,” he said, “and that’s where
I’ll never knock it.”</p>

<p>“But what about my boy’s practice?”
Mr. Bulstrode replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“Ah, we’ll see about that,” said the
Yorkshireman.</p>

<p>But, as a matter of fact, Roderick got
his practice according to the bargain, for,
as it happened, it was Mr. Bulstrode who
caught Hirst, at third man.</p>

<p>I need hardly tell you that Roderick
dreamed that night. His sleep was full
of Hirsts, all jolly and all hitting catches
which his father buttered. But in the
morning, when he knew how true his
luck was, he was almost too happy. Hirst
was as good as his word, and they practised
in the nets together for nearly half an hour,
and Roderick nearly bowled him twice.</p>

<p>In Middlesex’s next innings Roderick’s
father made thirty-five, all of which
Roderick scored with the greatest care;
but the match could not be finished owing
to a very heavy shower, and so this
innings did not matter very much one
way or the other, except that it made Mr.
Bulstrode’s place safe for another match.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>Of that match I am not going to tell;
but I have perhaps said enough to
show you how exceedingly delightful
it must be to have a father who plays for
his county.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE MONKEY’S REVENGE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a little girl
named Clara Amabel Platts. She lived
in Kensington, near the Gardens, and
every day when it was fine she walked
with Miss Hobbs round the Round Pond.
Miss Hobbs was her governess. When
it was wet she read a book, or as much of
a book as she could, being still rather
weak in the matter of long words. When
she did not read she made wool-work
articles for her aunts, and now and then
something for her mother’s birthday
present or Christmas present, which was
supposed to be a secret, but which her
mother, however hard she tried not to
look, always knew all about. But this
did not prevent her mother, who was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
very nice lady, from being extraordinarily
surprised when the present was given to
her. (That word “extraordinarily,” by
the way, is one of the words which Clara
would have had to pass over if she were
reading this story to herself; but you, of
course, are cleverer.)</p>

<p>It was generally admitted by Mrs.
Platts, and also by Miss Hobbs and Kate
Woodley the nurse, that Clara was a very
good girl; but she had one fault which
troubled them all, and that was too much
readiness in saying what came into her
mind. Mrs. Platts tried to check her by
making her count five before she made
any comment on what was happening,
so that she could be sure that she
really ought to say it; and Kate Woodley
used often to click her tongue when Clara
was rattling on; but Miss Hobbs had
another and more serious remedy. She
used to tell Clara to ask herself three
questions before she made any of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
quick little remarks. These were the
questions: (1) “Is it kind?” (2) “Is it
true?” (3) “Is it necessary?” If the
answer to all three was “Yes,” then Clara
might say what she wanted to; otherwise
not. The result was that when Clara and
Miss Hobbs walked round the Round
Pond Clara had very little to say; because,
you know, if it comes to that, hardly anything
is necessary.</p>

<p>Well, on December 20, 1907, the postman
brought Mrs. Platts a letter from
Clara’s aunt, Miss Amabel Patterson of
Chislehurst, after whom she had been
named, and it was that letter which makes
this story. It began by saying that Miss
Patterson would very much like Clara to
have a nice Christmas present, and it
went on to say that if she had been very
good lately, and continued good up to the
time of buying the present, it was to cost
seven-and-six, but if she had not been very
good it was only to cost a shilling. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
shows you the kind of aunt Miss Patterson
was. For myself, I don’t think that at
Christmas-time a matter of good or bad
behaviour ought to be remembered at all.
And I think that everything then ought
to cost seven-and-six. But Miss Patterson
had her own way of doing things; and it
did not really matter about the shilling at
all, because, as it was agreed that Clara
had been very good for a long time, Mrs.
Platts (who did not admire Miss Patterson’s
methods any more than we do) naturally
decided that unless anything still were to
happen (which is very unlikely with six-and-sixpence
at stake) the present should
cost seven-and-six, just as if nothing about
a shilling had ever been said.</p>

<p><i>Unless anything were to happen.</i> Ah!
Everything in this story depends on that.</p>

<p>Clara was as good as gold all the morning,
and she and Miss Hobbs marched
round the Round Pond like soldiers, Miss
Hobbs talking all the time and Clara as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
dumb as a fish. At dinner also she behaved
beautifully, although the pudding
was not at all what she liked; and then it
was time for her mother to take her out
to buy the present. So, still good, Clara
ran upstairs to be dressed.</p>

<p>As I dare say you know, there are in
Kensington High Street a great many large
shops, and the largest of these, which is
called Biter’s, has a very nice way every
December of filling one of its windows
(which for the rest of the year is full of dull
things, such as tables, and rolls of carpets,
and coal scuttles) with such seasonable and
desirable articles as boats for the Round
Pond, and dolls of all sorts and sizes, and
steam engines with quite a lot of rails and
signals, and clockwork animals, and guns.
And when you go inside you can’t help
hearing the gramaphone.</p>

<p>It was into this shop that Mrs. Platts
and Clara went, wondering whether they
would buy just one thing that cost seven-and-six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span> 
all at once, or a lot of smaller
things that came to seven-and-six altogether;
which is one of the pleasantest
problems to ponder over that this life
holds. Well, everything was going splendidly,
and Clara, after many changings of
her mind, had just decided on a beautiful
wax doll with cheeks like tulips and real
black hair, when she chanced to look up
and saw a funny little old gentleman come
in at the door; and all in a flash she forgot
her good resolutions and everything
that was depending on them, and seizing
her mother’s arm, and giving no thought
at all to Miss Hobbs’s three questions, or
to Kate Woodley’s clicking tongue, or to
counting five, she cried in a loud quick
whisper, “Oh, mother, do look at that
queer little man! Isn’t he just like a
monkey?”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_080_facing">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“DO LOOK AT THAT QUEER LITTLE MAN!”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now there were two dreadful things
about this speech. One was that it was
made before Aunt Amabel’s present had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
been bought, and therefore Mrs. Platts
was only entitled to spend a shilling, and
the other was that the little old gentleman
quite clearly heard it, for his face flushed
and he looked exceedingly uncomfortable.
Indeed, it was an uncomfortable time for
every one, for Mrs. Platts was very unhappy
to think that her little girl not only
should have lost the nice doll, but also
have been so rude; the little old gentleman
was confused and nervous; the girl
who was waiting on them was distressed
when she knew what Clara’s unlucky
speech had cost her; and Clara herself
was in a passion of tears. After some
time, in which Mrs. Platts and the girl
did their best to soothe her, Clara consented
to receive a shilling box of chalks
as her present, and was led back still sobbing.
Never was there such a sad ending
to an exciting expedition.</p>

<p>Miss Hobbs luckily had gone home;
but Kate Woodley made things worse by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
being very sorry and clicking away like a
Bee clock, and Clara hardly knew how to
get through the rest of the day.</p>

<p>Clara’s bedtime came always at a quarter
to eight, and between her supper, which
was at half-past six, and that hour she
used to come downstairs and play with
her father and mother. On this evening
she was very quiet and miserable, although
Mrs. Platts and Mr. Platts did all they
could to cheer her; and she even committed
one of the most extraordinary
actions of her life, for she said, when it
was still only half-past seven, that she
should like to go to bed.</p>

<p>And she would have gone had not at
that very moment a tremendous knock
sounded at the front door—so tremendous
that, in spite of her unhappiness, Clara
had, of course, to wait and see what it
was.</p>

<p>And what do you think it was? It
was a box addressed to Mrs. Platts, and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
came from Biter’s, the very shop where the
tragedy had occurred.</p>

<p>“But I haven’t ordered anything,” said
Mrs. Platts.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Mr. Platts, who
had a practical mind. “Open it.”</p>

<p>So the box was opened, and inside was
a note, and this is what it said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,<br>
</p>

<p><span class="indentleft2">“I am so distressed to think that I</span>
am the cause of your little girl losing her
present, that I feel there is nothing I can
do but give her one myself. For if I had
not been so foolish—at my age too!—as
to go to Biter’s this afternoon, without
any real purpose but to look round, she
would never have got into trouble. Biter’s
is for children, not for old men with queer
faces. And so I beg leave to send her
this doll, which I hope is the right one,
and with it a few clothes and necessaries,
and I am sure that she will not forget how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
it was that she very nearly lost it altogether.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Believe me, yours penitently,</span></p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">The Little-old-gentleman-who-really-is-(as-his-looking-glass-has-too-often-told-him)-like-a-monkey.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>To Clara this letter, when Mrs. Platts
read it to her, seemed like something in a
dream, but when the box was unpacked it
was found to contain, truly enough, not
only the identical doll which she had
wanted, with cheeks like tulips and real
black hair, but also frocks for it, and
night-dresses and petticoats, and a card of
tortoiseshell toilet requisites, and three
hats, and a diabolo set, and a tiny doll’s
parasol for Kensington Gardens on sunny
days.</p>

<p>Poor Clara didn’t know what to do,
and so she simply sat down with the doll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
in her arms and cried again; but this was
a totally different kind of crying from that
which had gone before. And when Kate
Woodley came to take her to bed she
cried too.</p>

<p>And the funny thing is that, though the
little old gentleman’s present looks much
more like a reward for being naughty
than a punishment, Clara has hardly ever
since said a quick unkind thing that
she could be sorry for, and Miss Hobbs’s
three questions are never wanted at all,
and Kate Woodley has entirely given up
clicking.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE NOTICE-BOARD</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a family
called Morgan—Mr. Morgan the father,
Mrs. Morgan the mother, Christopher
Morgan, aged twelve, Claire Morgan,
aged nine, Betty Morgan, aged seven, a
fox-terrier, a cat, a bullfinch, a nurse, a
cook, a parlourmaid, a housemaid, and
a boy named William. William hardly
counts, because he came only for a few
hours every day, and then lived almost
wholly in the basement, and when he did
appear above-stairs it was always in the
company of a coal-scuttle. That was the
family; and at the time this story begins
it had just removed from Bloomsbury to
Bayswater.</p>

<p>While the actual moving was going on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Christopher Morgan, Claire Morgan, and
Betty Morgan, with the dog and the bullfinch,
had gone to Sandgate to stay with
their grandmother, who, with extraordinary
good sense, lived in a house
with a garden that ran actually to the
beach, so that, although in stormy weather
the lawn was covered with pebbles, in fine
summer weather you could run from your
bedroom into the sea in nothing but a
bath-towel or a dressing-gown, or one of
those bath-towels which are dressing-gowns.
Christopher used to do this, and
Claire would have joined him but that the
doctor forbade it on account of what he
called her defective circulation—two long
words which mean cold feet.</p>

<p>When, however, the moving was all
done and the new house quite ready, the
three children and the dog and the bullfinch
returned to London, and getting by
great good luck a taxicab at Charing
Cross, were whirled to No. 23, Westerham<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
Gardens almost in a minute, at a cost
of two-and-eightpence, with fourpence
supplement for the luggage. Christopher
sat on the front seat, watching the meter
all the time, and calling out whenever it
had swallowed another twopence. The
first eightpence, as you have probably also
noticed, goes slowly, but after that the
twopences disappear just like sweets.</p>

<p>It is, as you know, a very exciting thing
to move to a new house. Everything
seems so much better than in the last,
especially the cupboards and the wall-papers.
In place of the old bell-pulls you
find electric bells, and there is a speaking-tube
between the dining-room and the
kitchen, and the coal-cellar is much larger,
and the bath-room has a better arrangement
of taps, and you can get hot water
on the stairs. But, of course, the electric
light is the most exciting thing of all,
and it was so at Westerham Gardens,
because in Bloomsbury there had been gas.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
But Mr. Morgan was exceedingly serious
about it, and delivered a lecture on the
importance—the vital importance—of
always turning off the switch as you leave
the room, unless, of course, there is some
one in it.</p>

<p>Christopher and Claire and Betty were
riotously happy in their new home for
some few days, especially as they were so
near Kensington Gardens, only a very
little way, in fact, from the gate where the
Dogs’ Cemetery is.</p>

<p>And then suddenly they began to miss
something. What it was they had no
idea; but they knew that in some mysterious
way, nice as the new house was, in
one respect it was not so nice as the old
one. Something was lacking.</p>

<p>It was quite by chance that they discovered
what it was; for, being sent one
morning to Whiteley’s, on their return
they entered Westerham Gardens by a
new way, and there on a board fixed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
the railings of the corner house they read
the terrible words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="bbox">
<p class="center">ORGANS AND STREET CRIES<br>
<br>
PROHIBITED.</p>     
</div></div></div>

<p>Then they all knew in an instant what
it was that had vaguely been troubling
them in their new house. It was a house
without music—a house that stood in a
neighbourhood where there were no
bands, no organs, and no costermongers.</p>

<p>“What a horrid shame!” said Claire.
And then they began to talk about the
organs and bands that used to come to
their old home in Bloomsbury.</p>

<p>“Do you remember the Italian woman
in the yellow handkerchief on Thursday
mornings during French?” said Christopher.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Betty, “and the monkey
boy with the accordion on Mondays.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>“And the Punch and Judy on Wednesday
afternoons,” said Claire.</p>

<p>“And ‘Fresh wallflowers,’ ‘Nice wallflowers!’
at eleven o’clock every day in
spring,” said Christopher.</p>

<p>“And the band that always played
‘Poppies’ on Tuesday evenings at bedtime,”
said Claire.</p>

<p>“And the organ with the panorama on
Friday mornings,” said Betty.</p>

<p>“And the best organ of all, that had
one new tune every week, on Saturdays,”
said Christopher.</p>

<p>“It must be a great day for the organists
when they have a new tune,” said
Claire.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Betty; “but you have forgotten
the funniest of all—the old man
with a wooden leg on Tuesday and
Friday.”</p>

<p>“But he had only one tune,” said Christopher</p>

<p>“It was a very nice tune,” said Betty. “But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
why I liked him was because he
always nodded and smiled at me.”</p>

<p>“That was only his trick,” said Christopher.
“They all do that if they think
you have a penny.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” said Betty stoutly; “he
did it as if he meant it.”</p>

<p>That night, just after Claire had undressed,
Christopher came in and sat on her
bed. “I’ve got an idea,” he said. “Let’s
have a new notice-board painted with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="bbox">
<p class="center">ORGANS AND STREET CRIES<br>
<br>
INVITED</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>on it, and have it fixed on our railings.
Then we shall get some music again. I
reckon that Mr. Randall’s son would make
it just like the other for about four shillings,
and that’s what we’ve got.”</p>

<p>Mr. Randall’s son was the family carpenter,
and he was called that because his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
father had been the family carpenter before
him for many years. When his father,
Mr. Randall, was alive, the son had no
name, but was always referred to as Mr.
Randall’s son, and now that the old man
was dead he was still spoken of in that
way, although he was a man of fifty and
had sons of his own. (But what they
would be called it makes my head ache to
think.)</p>

<p>Mr. Randall’s son smiled when he was
asked if he could and would make a notice-board.
“I will, Master Christopher,” he
said; “but I’m thinking you had better
spend your money on something else. A
nice boat, now, for the Round Pond. Or
a pair of stilts—I could make you a pair
of stilts in about an hour.” Poor Christopher
looked wistful, and then bravely
said that he would rather have the notice-board.
After giving careful instructions
as to the style of painting the words, he
impressed upon Mr. Randall’s son the importance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
of wrapping the board very carefully
in paper when he brought it back,
because it was a surprise.</p>

<p>“A surprise!” said Mr. Randall’s son
with a great hearty laugh; “I should
think it will be a surprise to some of ’em.
I’d like to be there to see the copper’s face
when he reads it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Randall’s son was not there to see
the copper’s face; but the copper—by
which Mr. Randall’s son meant the policeman—did
read it in the company of about
forty other persons, chiefly errand-boys
and cabmen, in front of the Morgans’
house on the morning after Christopher
had skilfully fixed it to the area railings;
and having read it he walked off quickly
to the nearest police-station to take advice.</p>

<p>The result was that just as Mr. Morgan
was leaving for the city the policeman
knocked at the door and asked to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. Morgan soon afterwards came from
the study and showed the policeman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
out, and then he sent for Christopher.
After Christopher had confessed, “My
dear boy,” he said, “this won’t do at all.
That notice-board at the end of this street
means either that the owners of Westerham
Gardens or a large number of the
tenants wish the neighbourhood to be free
from street music. If we, who are new-comers,
set up notice-boards to a contrary
effect, we are doing a very rude and improper
thing. I quite understand that
you miss the organs that we used to have,
but the only way to get them back would
be to obtain the permission of every one
in the Gardens; and that, of course, is
absurd.” With these words, which he
afterwards wished he had never used, Mr.
Morgan hurried off to the nearest Tube to
make money in the city, which was how
he spent his days.</p>

<p>Christopher carried the news to Claire,
who at once said, “Then we must go to
every house to get leave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“Of course,” said Christopher. “How
ripping!”</p>

<p>And they started immediately.</p>

<p>It would take too long to tell you how
they got on at each house. From some
they were sent away; at others they met
with sympathy.</p>

<p>Their words to the servant who opened
the door were: “Please give your mistress
the compliments of No. 23, and ask if she
really wants street music to be prohibited.”</p>

<p>“Of course we don’t, my dears,” said an
old lady at No. 14. “We should love to
have a nice pianoforte organ every now
and then, or even a band; but it would
never do to say so. Every one is so select
about here. Why, in that house opposite
lives the widow of a Lord Mayor.”</p>

<p>Claire made a note of the number to
tell Betty, who loved rank and grandeur,
and then they ascended the next steps,
where they found the most useful person
of all, a gentleman who came down to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
them, smoking a pipe and wearing carpet
slippers. “In reply to your question,” he
said, “I should welcome street music; but
the matter has nothing to do either with
me or with you. It is all settled by the
old lady at the corner, the house to which
the notice-board is fixed. It is she who
owns the property, and it is she who stops
the organs. If you want to do any good
you must see her. Her name is Miss
Seaton, and as you will want a little cake
and lemonade to give you strength for the
interview, you had better come in here for
a moment.” So saying he led them into
the dining-room, which was hung with
coloured pictures of hunting and racing,
and made them very comfortable, and
then sent them on with best wishes for
good luck.</p>

<p>Telling Claire to wait a moment, Christopher
ran off to their own house for the
board, and returned quickly with it
wrapped up under his arm. He rang the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
bell of the corner house boldly, and then,
seeing a notice which ran, “Do not knock
unless an answer is required,” knocked
boldly, too. It was opened by an elderly
butler. “Please tell Miss Seaton that Mr.
and Miss Morgan from No. 23 would like
to see her,” said Christopher.</p>

<p>“On what business?” asked the butler.</p>

<p>“On important business to Westerham
Gardens,” said Christopher.</p>

<p>“Wait here a moment,” said the butler,
and creaked slowly upstairs. “Here” was
the hall, and they sat on a polished
mahogany form, with a little wooden
roller at each end, exactly opposite a
stuffed dancing bear with his arms hungry
for umbrellas. Upstairs they heard a door
open and a muttered conversation, and
then the door shut and the butler creaked
slowly down again.</p>

<p>“Will you come this way?” he said, and
creaked slowly up once more, followed by
the children, who had great difficulty in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
finding the steps at that pace, and showed
them into a room in which was sitting an
old lady in a high-backed arm-chair near
the fire. On the hearthrug were five cats,
and there was one in her lap and one on
the table. “Oh!” thought Claire, “if
only Betty was here!” For Betty not
only loved rank and grandeur but adored
cats.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the old lady, “what is it?”</p>

<p>“If you please,” said Christopher, “we
have come about the notice-board outside,
which says, ‘Organs and street cries prohibited.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Claire broke in; “you see, we
have just moved to No. 23, and at our old
home—in Bloomsbury, you know—there
was such a lot of music, and a Punch and
Judy, and there’s none here, and we
wondered if it really meant it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_103_facing">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_103_facing.jpg" alt="WE HAD IT MADE ON PURPOSE">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“WE HAD IT MADE ON PURPOSE.”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“Because,” Christopher went on, “it
seemed to us that this notice-board”—and
here he unwrapped the new one—“could
just as easily be put up as the one you
have. We had it made on purpose.”
And he held it up before Miss Seaton’s
astonished eyes.</p>

<p>“‘Organs and street cries <i>invited</i>!’”
she exclaimed. “Why, I never heard
such a thing in my life. They drive me
frantic.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you put cotton-wool in your
ears?” Claire asked.</p>

<p>“Or ask them to move a little further
on—nearer No. 23?” said Christopher.</p>

<p>“But, my dear children,” said the old
lady, “you really are very wilful. I hope
your father and mother don’t know what
you are doing.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Christopher.</p>

<p>“Well, sit down, both of you,” said
Miss Seaton, “and let us talk it over.”
So they sat down, and Claire took up one
of the cats and stroked it behind the ears,
and Miss Seaton asked them a number of
questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>After a while she rang the bell for the
butler, who creaked in and out and then
in again with cake and a rather good
syrup to mix with water; and they
gradually became quite friendly, not only
with Miss Seaton, but with each of the
cats in turn.</p>

<p>“Are there any more?” Claire asked.</p>

<p>“No, only seven,” said Miss Seaton.
“I never have more and I never have
fewer.”</p>

<p>“Do you give them all names?” said
Claire.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Miss Seaton. “That
is partly why there are only seven. I
name them after the days of the week.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” thought Claire again, “if only
Betty were here!”</p>

<p>“The black one there, with the white
front, is Sunday,” Miss Seaton continued.
“That all black one is Monday—black
Monday, you know. The tortoiseshell is
Friday. The sandy one is Saturday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“It was on Saturday,” said Christopher,
“that the best organ of all used to
come, the one with a new tune every
week.”</p>

<p>“The blue Persian is Wednesday,” said
Miss Seaton, not taking any notice of his
remark. “The white Persian is Tuesday,
and the grey Iceland cat is Thursday.
And now,” she added, “you must go
home, and I will think over your request
and let you have the answer.”</p>

<p>That evening, just after the children
had finished their supper, a ring came at
the door, followed, after it was opened, by
scuffling feet and a mysterious thud.
Then the front door banged, and Annie
the maid came in to say that there was a
heavy box in the hall, addressed to Master
and Miss Morgan. The children tore
out, and found a large case with, just as
Annie had said, Christopher and Claire’s
name upon it. Christopher rushed off for
a hammer and screw-driver, and in a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
minutes the case was opened. Inside was
a note and a very weighty square thing in
brown paper. Christopher began to undo
the paper, while Claire read the note
aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“1, <span class="smcap">Westerham Gardens, W.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Miss and Master Morgan</span>,</p>

<p><span class="indentleft2">“I have been thinking about your</span>
request all the afternoon, as I promised I
would, and have been compelled to decide
against it in the interests not only of the
property but of several of my old tenants,
whose nerves cannot bear noise. But as I
feel that your father, when he made inquiries
about your new house, was not
sufficiently informed as to the want of
entertainment in the neighbourhood, I
wish to make it up in so far as I can to
you all for your disappointment, and therefore
beg your acceptance of a musical box
which was a great pleasure to me when I
was much younger, and may, I trust, do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
something to amuse you, although the
tunes are, I fear, not of the newest.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Believe me yours sincerely,</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Victoria Seaton</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p>“There, father,” said Christopher, “you
see she wasn’t really cross at all.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mr. Morgan; “but, all the
same, this must be the last of such escapades.”</p>

<p>Then he opened the musical box, and
they found from the piece of paper inside
the lid, written in violet ink in a thin, upright,
rather curly foreign hand, that it
had twelve tunes. Mr. Morgan wound
it up, and they all stood round watching
the great brass barrel, with the little spikes
on it, slowly revolve, while the teeth of
the comb were caught up one by one by
the spikes to make the notes. There was
also a little drum and a peal of silver bells.
Although old, it was in excellent order,
and very gentle and ripply in tone; and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
wish I had been there too, for it is a long
time since I heard a musical box, every
one now having gramaphones with sore
throats.</p>

<p>The first tune was “The Last Rose of
Summer” and the second the beautiful
prison song from “Il Trovatore.” When
it came to the seventh the children looked
at each other and smiled.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Betty, “that’s the tune
the nice man with the wooden leg on
Tuesdays and Fridays always played.”</p>

<p>And what do you think it was? It was
“Home, sweet Home.”</p>

hay-field was forbidden until after hay-making;
but when a doll is expected from
Paris...!</p>

<p>Christina’s father was better than his
word, for it was the most beautiful doll
ever made, with a whole wardrobe of
clothes, too.</p>

<p>Also a tiny tortoiseshell comb and a
powder puff. Also an extra pair of
bronzed boots. Her eyes opened and
shut, and even her eyebrows were real
hair. This, as you know, is unusual in
dolls, their hair, as a rule, being made of
other materials and far too yellow, and
their eyebrows being just paint. “She
shall be called Diana,” said Christina, who
had always loved the name from afar.</p>

<p>Christina took Diana to her mother at
once, Roy running behind her with the
box and the brown paper and the string
and the wardrobe, and Chrissie calling
back every minute, “Don’t drop the
powder puff whatever you do!” “Hold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
tight to the hand-glass!” and things like
that.</p>

<p>“It’s splendid!” Mrs. Tiverton said.
“There isn’t a better doll in the world;
only, Chrissie dear, be very careful with
it. I don’t know but that father would
have done better to have got something
stronger—this is so very fragile. I think
perhaps you had better have it only indoors.
Yes, that’s the best way; after
to-day you must play with Diana only
indoors.”</p>

<p>It was thus that Diana came to Mapleton.</p>

<p>How Christina loved her that first day!
She carried her everywhere and showed
her everything—all over the house, right
into the attics; all over the garden, right
into the little black stove-place under the
greenhouse, where Pedder, the gardener,
read last Sunday’s paper over his lunch;
into the village, to the general shop, to introduce
her to the postmistress, who lived
behind a brass railing in the odour of bacon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
and calico; into the stables, to kiss Lord
Roberts, the old white horse. Jim, who
groomed the General, was the only person
who did not admire the doll properly; but
how could you expect a nice feeling from
a boy who sets dogs on rats?</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>It was two or three days after this that
Roy went down to the river to fish. He
had to go alone, because Christina wanted
to play with Diana in the nursery; but
not more than half an hour had passed
when he heard feet swishing through the
long grass behind him, and, looking up,
there was Christina. Now, as Christina
had refused so bluntly to have anything to
do with his fishing, Roy was surprised to
see her, but more surprised still to see
that Diana had come too.</p>

<p>“Why, surely mother never said you
might bring Diana?” he exclaimed.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_114_facing">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_114_facing.jpg" alt="THERE WAS CHRISTINA">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">THERE WAS CHRISTINA.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“No,” said Christina, rather sulkily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
“but I didn’t think she’d mind. Besides,
she’s gone to the village, and I couldn’t
ask her.”</p>

<p>Roy looked troubled; his mother did not
often make rules to interfere with their play,
and when she did she liked to be obeyed.
She had certainly forbidden Christina to
take Diana out of the house. He did not say
anything. Christina sat down and began
to play. She was not really at all happy,
because she knew it was wrong of her to
have disobeyed, and she was really a very
good girl. Roy went on fishing.</p>

<p>“Oh, do do something else,” Christina
cried pettishly, after a few minutes. “It’s
so cold sitting here waiting for you to
catch stupid fish that never come. Let’s
go to the cave.” The cave was an old
disused lime-kiln, where robbers might
easily have lived.</p>

<p>“All right,” Roy said.</p>

<p>“I’ll get there first,” Christina called
out, beginning to run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“Bah!” said Roy, and ran after. They
had raced for a hundred yards, when,
with a cry, Christina fell. Roy, who was
still some distance behind, having had to
pack up his rod, hastened to Christina’s
side. He found her looking anxiously
into Diana’s face.</p>

<p>“Oh, Roy,” she wailed, “her eyes have
gone!”</p>

<p>It was too true. Diana, lately so radiantly
observant, now turned to the world the
blankest of empty sockets. Roy took her
poor head in his hand and shook it. A
melancholy rattle told that a pair of once
serviceable blue eyes were now at large.
Christina sank on the grass in an agony
of grief—due partly, also, to the knowledge
that if she had not been naughty
this would never have happened. Roy
stood by, feeling hardly less unhappy.
After a while he took her arm. “Come
along,” he said; “let’s see if Jim can
mend her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“Jim!” Christina cried in a fury,
shaking off his hand.</p>

<p>“But come along, anyway,” Roy said.</p>

<p>Christina continued sobbing. After a
while she moved to rise, but suddenly fell
back again. Her sobbing as suddenly
ceased. “Roy!” she exclaimed fearfully,
“I can’t walk.”</p>

<p>Christina had sprained her ankle.</p>

<p>Roy ran to the house as fast as he could
to find help, and very soon old Pedder, the
gardener, and Jim were carrying Christina
between them, with mother, who had just
come back, and nurse, walking by her side.
Christina was put to bed and her foot
wrapped in bandages, but she cried almost
incessantly, no matter how often she was
assured that she was forgiven. “Her
sobs,” the cook said, coming downstairs
after her twentieth visit to the nursery—“her
sobs are that heartrending I couldn’t
stand it; and all the while she asks for
that blessed doll, which its eyes is rattling in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
its head like marbles, through falling on
the ground, and Master Roy and Jim’s
trying to catch them with a skewer.”</p>

<p>Cook was quite right. Roy and Jim,
with Diana between them, were seated in
the harness-room, probing tenderly the
depths of that poor Parisienne’s skull. A
housemaid was looking on without enthusiasm.
“You won’t do it,” she said
every now and then; “you can’t catch
dolls’ eyes with skewers. No one can.
It’s impossible. The King himself
couldn’t. The Primest Minister couldn’t.
No,” she went on, “no one could do it.
No one but the Miss Bannisters’ Brother
near where I live at Dormstaple. He
could. You ought to take it to him.
He’d mend it in a jiffy—there’s nothing
he can’t do in that way.”</p>

<p>Roy said nothing, but went on prodding
and probing. At last he gave up in
despair. “All right, I’ll take it to the
Miss Bannisters’ Brother,” he said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
“Dormstaple’s only six miles.” But a
sudden swoop from a figure in the doorway
interrupted his bold plan.</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the kind,” cried
nurse, seizing the doll, “with that angel
upstairs crying for it every minute, and
the doctor saying she’s in a high fever
with lying on the wet grass”; and with a
swirl of white skirts and apron, nurse and
Diana were gone.</p>

<p>Roy put his hands in his pockets and
wandered moodily into the garden. The
world seemed to have no sun in it any
more.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The next day Christina was really ill. It
was not only the ankle, but she had
caught a chill, the doctor said, and they
must be very careful with her. Roy
went about with a sad and sadder face,
for Christina was his only playmate, and
he loved her more than anything else;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
besides, there was now no one to bowl to
him, and also it seemed so silly not to be
able to mend a doll’s eyes. He moped in
the house all the morning, and was continually
being sent away from Christina’s
door, because she was too ill to bear anyone
in the room except nurse. She was
wandering in her mind, nurse said, and
kept on saying that she had blinded her
doll, and crying to have its eyes made
right again; but she would not let a hand
be laid upon her, so that to have Diana
mended seemed impossible. Nurse cried
too, as she said it, and Roy joined with
her. He could not remember ever having
been so miserable.</p>

<p>The doctor looked very grave when he
was going away. “That doll ought to be
put right,” he said to Mrs. Tiverton.
“She’s a sensitive little thing, evidently,
and this feeling of disobeying you and
treating her father’s present lightly is
doing her a lot of harm, apart altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
from the chill and the sprain. If we
could get those eyes in again she’d be
better in no time, I believe.”</p>

<p>Roy and his mother heard this with
a sinking heart, for they knew that
Christina’s arms locked Diana to her side
almost as if they were bars of iron.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” the doctor said, “I’ve left
some medicine that ought to give her
some sleep, and I shall come again this
afternoon.” So saying, he touched up his
horse, and Mrs. Tiverton walked into the
house again.</p>

<p>Roy stood still pondering.</p>

<p>Suddenly his mind was made up, and he
set off for the high road at a good swinging
pace. At the gate he passed Jim.
“If they want to know where I am,” he
called, “say I’ve gone to Dormstaple, to
the Miss Bannisters’ Brother.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Miss Sarah Bannister and Miss Selina
Bannister had lived in Dormstaple as long
almost as anyone could remember, although
they were by no means old. They had the
red house with white windows, the kind
of house which one can see only in old
English market-towns. There was a gravel
drive before it, in the shape of a banana,
the carriages going in at one end and out
at the other, stopping at the front doorsteps
in the middle. A china cockatoo
hung in the window. The door knocker
was of the brightest brass; it was a pleasure
to knock it.</p>

<p>Behind the house was a very large
garden, with a cedar in the midst, and a
very soft lawn, on which the same birds
settled every morning in winter for the
breakfast that the Miss Bannisters provided.
The cedar and the other trees had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
cigar-boxes nailed to them, for tits or
wrens to build in, and half cocoa-nuts and
lumps of fat were always hung just outside
the windows. In September button
mushrooms grew on the lawn—enough
for breakfast every morning. At one side
of the house was the stable and coach-house,
on the other side a billiard-room,
now used as a workshop. And this workshop
brings us to the Miss Bannisters’
Brother.</p>

<p>The Miss Bannisters’ Brother was an
invalid, and he was also what is called
eccentric. “Eccentric, that’s what he is,”
Mr. Stallabrass, who kept the King’s
Arms, had said, and there could be no
doubt of it after that. This meant that he
wore rather shabby clothes, and took no
interest in the town, and was rarely seen
outside the house or the garden.</p>

<p>Rumour said, however, that he was
very clever with his hands, and could
make anything. What was the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
with the Miss Bannisters’ Brother no one
seemed to know, but it gradually kept
him more and more indoors.</p>

<p>No one ever spoke of him as Mr.
Bannister; they always said the Miss
Bannisters’ Brother. If you could see the
Miss Bannisters, especially Miss Selina,
you would understand this; but although
they had deep, gruff voices, they were
really very kind.</p>

<p>As time went on, and the Miss Bannisters’
Brother did not seem to grow any
better, or to be likely to take up his
gardening and his pigeons again, the Miss
Bannisters had racked their brains to think
of some employment for him other than
reading, which is not good for anyone all
day long. One evening, some years before
this story, while the three were at
tea, Miss Selina cried suddenly, “I have
it!”—so suddenly, indeed, that Miss Sarah
spilt her cup, and her brother took three
lumps of sugar instead of two.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“Have what?” they both exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Why,” she said, “I was talking to-day
with Mrs. Boniface, and she was saying
how nice it would be if there was some
one in the town who could mend toys—poor
Miss Piper at the Bazaar being so
useless, and all the carpenters understanding
nothing but making book-shelves
and cucumber-frames, and London
being so far away—and I said, ‘Yes,’
never thinking of Theodore here.
And, of course, it’s the very thing for
him.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Miss Sarah. “He
could take the old billiard-room.”</p>

<p>“And have a gas-stove put in it,” said
Miss Selina.</p>

<p>“An oil-stove,” said Miss Sarah; “it’s
more economical.”</p>

<p>“A gas-stove,” said Miss Selina; “it’s
more trustworthy.”</p>

<p>“And put up a bench,” said Miss
Sarah.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“And some cocoa-nut-matting on the
floor,” said Miss Selina.</p>

<p>“Linoleum,” said Miss Sarah; “it’s
cheaper.”</p>

<p>“Cocoa-nut-matting,” said Miss Selina;
“it’s better and warmer for his feet.”</p>

<p>“And we could call it the Dolls’
Hospital,” said Miss Sarah.</p>

<p>“Infirmary,” said Miss Selina.</p>

<p>“I prefer Hospital,” said Miss Sarah.</p>

<p>“Infirmary,” said Miss Selina. “Dr.
Bannister, house-surgeon, attends daily
from ten till one.”</p>

<p>“It would be the prettiest and kindliest
occupation,” said Miss Sarah, “as well as
a useful one.”</p>

<p>“That’s the whole point of it,” said
Miss Selina.</p>

<p>And that is how—five or six years ago—the
Miss Bannisters’ Brother came to
open the Dolls’ Infirmary. But he did
not stop short at mending dolls. He
mended all kinds of other things too; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
advised on the length of tails for kites; he
built ships; he had even made fireworks.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Roy walked into Dormstaple at about
one o’clock, very tired and hot and dusty
and hungry. With the exception of a lift
for a mile and a half in the baker’s cart, he
had had to walk or run all the way. A
little later, after asking his way more than
once, he stood on the doorstep of the
Miss Bannisters’ house. The door was
opened by old Eliza, and as the flavour of
roast fowl rushed out, Roy knew how
hungry he was. “I want to see the Miss
Bannisters’ Brother,” he said, “please.”</p>

<p>“You’re too late,” was the answer,
“and it’s the wrong door. Come to-morrow
morning, and go to the Hinfirmary.
Mr. Theodore never sees children
in the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I must,” Roy almost sobbed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>“Chut, chut!” said old Eliza, “little
boys shouldn’t say must.”</p>

<p>“But when they must, what else is
there for them to say?” Roy asked.</p>

<p>“Chut, chut!” said old Eliza again.
“That’s himperent! Now run away, and
come to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>This was too much for Roy. He
covered his face with his hands, and really
and truly cried—a thing he would scorn
to do on his own account.</p>

<p>While he stood there in this distress a
hand was placed on his arm and he was
drawn gently into the house. He heard
the door shut behind him. The hand
then guided him along passages into a
great room, and there he was liberated.
Roy looked round; it was the most
fascinating room he had ever seen. There
was a long bench at the window, with a
comfortable chair before it, and on the
bench were hammers and chisels and all
kinds of tools. A ship nearly finished lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
in one place, a clockwork steamer in
another, a pair of rails wound about the
floor on the cocoa-nut matting—in and
out like a snake—on which a toy train
probably ran, and here and there were
signals. On the shelves were coloured
papers, bottles, boxes, and wire. In one
corner was a huge kite, as high as a man,
with a great face painted on it. Several
dolls, more or less broken, lay on the
table.</p>

<p>All this he saw in a moment. Then
he looked at the owner of the hand, who
had been standing beside him all the
while with an amused expression on his
delicate, kind face. Roy knew in an
instant it was the Miss Bannisters’ Brother.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the Miss Bannisters’
Brother; “so when one must, one must?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Roy said half timidly.</p>

<p>“Quite right too,” said the Miss Bannisters’
Brother. “‘Must’ is a very good
word, if one has the character to back it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
up. And now tell me, quickly, what is
the trouble? Something very small, I
should think, or you wouldn’t be able to
carry it in your pocket.”</p>

<p>“It’s not in my pocket,” Roy said;
“it’s not here at all. I want—I want a
lesson.”</p>

<p>“A lesson?” the Miss Bannisters’
Brother asked in surprise.</p>

<p>“Yes, in eye-mending. When eyes
fall inside and rattle, you know.”</p>

<p>The Miss Bannisters’ Brother sat down,
and took Roy between his knees. There
was something about this little dusty,
nervous boy that his clients (often tearful
enough) had never displayed before, and
he wished to understand it. “Now tell
me all about it,” he said.</p>

<p>Roy told him everything, right from
the first.</p>

<p>“And what is your father’s name?” was
the only question that had to be asked.
When he heard this, the Miss Bannisters’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
Brother rose. “You must stay here a
minute,” he said.</p>

<p>“But—but the lesson?” Roy exclaimed.
“You know I ought to be getting back
again. Christina——”</p>

<p>“All right, just a minute,” the Miss
Bannisters’ Brother replied.</p>

<p>When the Miss Bannisters’ Brother
came back, Miss Selina came with him.
“Come and get tidy. You are just in
time for dinner,” she said, “and afterwards
we are going to drive home with
you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I can’t stop for dinner!” Roy
cried. “It’s much too important to stop
for dinner; I’m not really hungry, either.”</p>

<p>“Dinner will only take a little while,”
said Miss Selina, “and the horses can be
getting ready at the same time; and if
you were to walk you wouldn’t be home
nearly so soon as you will if you drive,
dinner-time included.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” said the Miss Bannisters’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
Brother, “I’m much too hungry to give
lessons. I need heaps of food—chicken
and things—before I can give a lesson.”</p>

<p>“But Christina——” Roy gasped again.</p>

<p>“And, as a matter of fact, we’ve
thought of a better way than the lesson,”
Miss Selina said. “Mr. Bannister is
going with you; but he must eat first,
mustn’t he?”</p>

<p>It took a moment for Roy to appreciate
this, but when he did he was the happiest
boy in Dormstaple.</p>

<p>He never tasted a nicer chicken, he
said afterwards.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Certainly not more than three-quarters
of an hour had passed before the carriage
was on its way to Mapleton—with the
Miss Bannisters’ Brother propped up with
cushions (for he could not bear the jolting
of carriages) on the back seat, and Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
Selina and Miss Sarah, who had come to
look after him, on the other. Roy was
on the box. You never saw such puzzled
faces as the Dormstaple people had when
the party went by, for the Miss Bannisters’
Brother had not driven out these twenty
years; but their surprise was nothing to
that of old Eliza, who wandered about the
rooms all the rest of the day muttering
“Little himperent boy!”</p>

<p>At the Mapleton gates Roy jumped
down and rushed up to the house. His
mother came to the door as he reached it.
“Oh, mother, mother,” he cried, “he’s
come himself!”</p>

<p>“Who has come?” she asked, forgetting
to say anything about Roy’s long absence.
“I hoped it was the doctor. Christina is
worse, I’m afraid; she won’t sleep.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” Roy assured her.
“I’ve brought the Miss Bannisters’ Brother,
who mends dolls and everything, and he’ll
put the eyes right in no time, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Chrissie’ll be well again. Here they
are!”</p>

<p>At this moment the carriage reached
the door; but Mrs. Tiverton’s perplexities
were not removed by it. On the contrary,
they were increased, for she saw
before her three total strangers. Miss
Selina, however, hastily stepped out and
took Mrs. Tiverton’s hand, and explained
the whole story, adding, “We are not
coming in; my sister and I have a call to
pay a little further on. We shall come
back in less than an hour for our brother,
carry him off, and be no trouble at all. I
know how little you must want just now
even people that you know.” In spite
of Mrs. Tiverton’s protest, Miss Selina
had her way, and the sisters drove off.</p>

<p>While this conversation had been in
progress, Roy had been speaking to the
Miss Bannisters’ Brother. He had been
preparing the speech ever since they had
started, for it was very important.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
“Please,” he said—“please how much
will this visit be, because I want to pay
for it myself?”</p>

<p>The Miss Bannisters’ Brother smiled.
“But suppose you haven’t enough?” he
said.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I think I have!” Roy told
him. “I’ve got seven-and-six, and when
the vet. came to see Lord Roberts it was
only five shillings.”</p>

<p>The Miss Bannisters’ Brother smiled
again. “Our infirmary is rather peculiar,”
he said. “We don’t take money
at all; we take promises; different kinds
of promises from different people, according
to their means. We ask rich patients’
friends to promise to give away old toys,
or story-books, or scrap-books, or something
of that kind, to real hospitals—children’s
hospitals. We find that much
better than money. Money’s such a
nuisance. One is always losing the key
of the money-box.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>Roy was a little disappointed. “Oh
yes!” he said, however, “I’ll do that.
Won’t I just? But, you know,” he added,
“you can always break open a money-box
if it comes to the worst. Pokers aren’t
bad. And there’s a way of getting the
money out with a table-knife.”</p>

<p>It was just then that the Miss Bannisters
drove off, and Mrs. Tiverton asked
their brother to come to Christina’s room
with her. Roy would have given anything
to have been allowed upstairs; but
as it was forbidden, he went to see Jim and
tell him the news. He found, however,
that the housemaid had already told not
only Jim but every one else.</p>

<p>“Now it will be all right,” she was
saying. “The Miss Bannisters’ Brother
will do it! Why, he made a wooden leg
for a tame jackdaw once!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span></p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Christina was moaning in the bed with
Diana locked in her arms when the Miss
Bannisters’ Brother sat down beside her.
“Come,” he said gently, “let me feel
your pulse.”</p>

<p>Christina pushed her wrist towards him
wearily.</p>

<p>“Oh no, not yours!” he said, with a
little laugh. “Yours doesn’t matter. I
meant this little lady’s. I’m not your
doctor. I’m a doll’s doctor.”</p>

<p>Christina turned her poor flushed face
towards him for the first time. A doll’s
doctor—it was a new idea. And he really
seemed to be all right—not anyone dressed
up to make her feel foolish or coax her
into taking horrid medicine. “Was it
your carriage I heard?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “I have come on
purpose. But so many dolls are ill just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
now that I must be getting away soon.
It’s quite a bad time for dolls, especially
French ones. They are very delicate.”</p>

<p>“Mine is French,” Christina said, growing
really interested.</p>

<p>“How very curious!” he answered.
“I had a French patient the other day—a
Parisian—whose sight had become so
weak that she had to wear glasses. And
now for the pulse,” he went on, and he
drew out a large gold watch.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tiverton was looking on with
tears in her eyes. Christina had not taken
this quiet interest in anything or kept so
still in bed for many hours. Not even the
sleeping draught had had any effect.</p>

<p>The Miss Bannisters’ Brother held
Diana’s tiny wrist and looked very grave.
“Dear, dear!” he said, “I ought to have
been sent for before, and then I could have
cured her here in your arms. As it is, I
must take her to the light. Won’t you
have that nice jelly while I am treating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
Miss——? Let me see, what is my
patient’s name?”</p>

<p>“Diana,” Christina said.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes—Miss Diana. By the time
you have finished the jelly I ought to have
finished my visit.” So saying he rose and
carried Diana to the window-seat behind
the curtains, while Mrs. Tiverton gave
Christina the jelly. Christina took it,
nurse said afterwards, like a lamb—though
I never saw a lamb take jelly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Miss Bannisters’ Brother
had taken some tools and a tube of seccotine
from his pocket, and he had lifted up
Diana’s hair, cut a hole in her head, and
was busily readjusting the machinery of
her eyes. It was all done in five minutes,
just as Christina was eating the last mouthful.
“There,” he said, returning to the
bedside, “that’s all right. It was a very
simple operation, and didn’t hurt at all. I
think our patient can see now as well as
ever.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>Christina peered into Diana’s face with
a cry of joy, and sank back on the pillow
in an ecstasy of content.</p>

<p>Neither Mrs. Tiverton nor the Miss
Bannisters’ Brother dared to move for
some minutes. While they sat there the
doctor tip-toed in. He crossed to the bed
and looked at Christina. “She’s asleep,”
he said. “Splendid! She’s all right
now. It was sleep she wanted more than
anything. Don’t let her hear a sound,
nurse, for hours.”</p>

<p>They found Roy waiting for the news.
When he heard it he jumped for joy.
His mother caught him up and hugged
him. “You thoughtful little imp!” she
cried—and, turning to the doctor, told
him the story. He went off, laughing.
“I shall take my door-plate down when
I get home,” he called out as he drove off,
“and send it round to you, Bannister.
You’re the real doctor.”</p>

<p>When the Miss Bannisters drove back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
they found tea all ready, and Mrs. Tiverton
would not hear of their leaving without
it. And when they did leave, an hour
later, they were all fast friends.</p>

<p>Roy and Christina never think of going
to Dormstaple now without calling at the
red house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> letter was addressed to Miss Mary
Stavely. It ran:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Mary</span>,</p>

<p>“I have just received five pounds
that I had given up for lost, and, remembering
what you told me at Easter of the
importance of distributing a little money
in the village, I think you had better have
it and become my almoner. An almoner
is one who gives away money for another.
I shall be interested in hearing how you
get on.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Your affectionate</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Uncle Herbert</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>Inside the letter was a five-pound note.</p>

<p>Mary read the letter for the twentieth
time, and for the twentieth time unfolded
the crackling five-pound note—more
money than she had ever seen before.
She was thirteen.</p>

<p>“But what shall I do with it?” she
asked. “So many people want things.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mustn’t ask me,” said her
mother. “Uncle Herbert wants you to
decide entirely for yourself. You must
make a list of every one in the village who
wants help, and then look into each case
very carefully.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Harry, Mary’s brother, as
he finished breakfast, “and don’t forget
me. My bicycle ought to be put right,
for one thing, and, for another, I haven’t
any more films for my camera. If that
isn’t a deserving case I’d like to know
what is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span></p>

<p>Mary read through her list and once
more added up the figures. They came
to £6 11s. 10d.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” she said, “I hadn’t any
idea it was so difficult to be an almoner.”</p>

<p>She went through the list again, and
brought it down to £5 0s. 10d. by knocking
off one week of Tommy Pringle’s
sea-side holiday and depriving the village
room of its gramaphone.</p>

<p>“I suppose I must make up the tenpence
myself,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>That afternoon Mary went to call on
Mr. Verney. Mr. Verney was an artist
who lived at the forge cottage. He and
Mary were great friends. She used to sit
by him while he painted, and he played
cricket with her and Harry and was very
useful with a pocket-knife.</p>

<p>“No one,” she said to herself, “can
help me so well as Mr. Verney, and if I
decide myself on how the money is to be
spent, it will be all right to get some help
in spending it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Verney liked the scheme immensely.
“But I don’t see that you want any help,”
he said. “You have done it so far as well
as possible.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mary, “there’s one great
difficulty: Thomas Barnes would never
take anything from our house. You see,
we once had his son for a gardener, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
father had to send him away because of
something he did; but though it was
altogether his son’s fault, Thomas Barnes
has never spoken to father since, or even
looked at him. But he’s very old and
poorly, and very lonely, and it’s most important
he should have a new hand-truck,
because all his living depends on it; but
it’s frightfully important that he shouldn’t
know who gave it to him.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t he guess?” Mr. Verney
said.</p>

<p>“Not if nobody knew.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see: no one is to know. That
makes it much more fun.”</p>

<p>“But how are we to do it?” Mary
asked. “That’s why I want you to help.
Of course, we can post most of the money,
but we can’t post a truck. If Thomas
Barnes knew, he’d send it back directly.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Verney, after thinking
for some time, “there’s only one way: we
shall have to be anti-burglars.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“Anti-burglars!” cried Mary. “What’s
that?”</p>

<p>“Well, a burglar is some one who breaks
into a house and takes things away; an
anti-burglar is some one who breaks into a
house and leaves things there. Just the
opposite, you see.”</p>

<p>“But suppose we are caught?”</p>

<p>“That would be funny. I don’t know
what the punishment for anti-burgling is.
I think perhaps the owner of the house
ought to be punished for being so foolish
as to interrupt. But tell me more about
Thomas Barnes.”</p>

<p>“Thomas Barnes,” said Mary, “lives in
a cottage by the cross-roads all alone.”</p>

<p>“What does he do?”</p>

<p>“He fetches things from the station for
people; he carries the washing home from
Mrs. Carter’s; he runs errands—at least,
he doesn’t run them: people wish he
would; he sometimes does a day’s work
in a garden. But he really must have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
new barrow, and his illness took all his
money away, because he wouldn’t belong
to a club. He’s quite the most obstinate
man in this part of the country. But he’s
so lonely, you know.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Mr. Verney, “we must
wait till he goes away on an errand.”</p>

<p>“But he locks his shed.”</p>

<p>“Then we must break in.”</p>

<p>“But if people saw us taking the barrow
there?”</p>

<p>“Then we must go in the night. I’ll
send him to Westerfield suddenly for something
quite late—some medicine, and then
he’ll think I’m ill—on a Thursday, when
there’s the midnight train, and we’ll pop
down to his place at about eleven with a
screw-driver and things.”</p>

<p>After arranging to go to Westerfield as
soon as possible to spend their money,
Mary ran home.</p>

<p>Being an almoner was becoming much
more interesting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Mr. Verney and Mary went to Westerfield
the next day, leaving a very sulky
Harry behind.</p>

<p>“I can’t think why Uncle Herbert
didn’t send that money to me,” he
grumbled. “Why should a girl like
Mary have all this almoning fun? I
could almon as well as she can.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Uncle Herbert had
made a very wise choice. Harry had
none of Mary’s interest in the village, nor
had he any of her patience. But in his
own way he was a very clever boy. He
bowled straight, and knew a linnet’s egg
from a greenfinch’s.</p>

<p>Mr. Verney and Mary’s first visit was to
the bank, where Mary handed her five-pound
note through the bars, and the clerk
scooped up four sovereigns and two half-sovereigns
in his little copper shovel and
poured them into her hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>Then they bought a penny account-book
and went on to Mr. Flower, the
ironmonger, to see about Thomas Barnes’
truck. Mr. Flower had a secondhand one
for twenty-five shillings, and he promised
to touch it up for two shillings more;
and he promised, also, that neither he nor
his man should ever say anything about it.
It was arranged that the barrow should be
wrapped up in sacking and taken to Mr.
Verney’s, inside the waggon, and be delivered
after dark.</p>

<p>“Why do <i>you</i> want it?” Mary asked
him.</p>

<p>“That’s a secret,” he said; “you’ll
know later.”</p>

<p>Mr. Flower also undertook to send
three shillings’ worth of netting to Mrs.
Callow, asking her to do him the favour of
trying it to see if it were a good strong kind.</p>

<p>Mary and Mr. Verney then walked on
to Mr. Costall, the dentist, who was in
Westerfield only on Thursdays between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
ten and four. It was the first time that
Mary had ever stood on his doorstep without
feeling her heart sink. Mr. Costall,
although a dentist, was a smiling, happy
man, and he entered into the scheme
directly. He said he would write to
Mrs. Meadows and ask her to call, saying
that some one whom he would not
mention had arranged the matter with
him. And when Mary asked him how
much she should pay him, he said that
ten shillings would do. This meant a
saving of half a crown.</p>

<p>“How nice it would be always to visit
Mr. Costall,” Mary said, with a sigh, “if
he did not pull out teeth.”</p>

<p>Mary and Mr. Verney then chose Mrs.
Wigram’s new bonnet, which they posted
to her at once. Mr. Verney liked one
with red roses, but Mary told him that
nothing would ever induce Mrs. Wigram
to wear anything but black. The girl in
the shop recommended another kind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
trimmed with a very blue bird; but Mary
had her own way.</p>

<p>Afterwards they bought a ball for the
Barretts; and then they bought a postal
order for eight shillings for Mrs. Carter,
and half a crown for Mr. Eyles, and ten
shillings for Mrs. Ryan, and fourteen
shillings for Mrs. Pringle. It was most
melancholy to see the beautiful sovereigns
dropping into other people’s tills. Mary
put all these amounts down in her penny
account-book. She also put down the cost
of her return ticket.</p>

<p>When they got back to the village they
saw Mr. Ward, the station-master. After
telling him how important it was to keep
the secret, Mary bought a return ticket to
the sea for Tommy Pringle, without any
date on it, and two excursion tickets for
old Mr. and Mrs. Snelling for the 1st of
next month. Mr. Ward did not have
many secrets in his life, and he was
delighted to keep these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>While they were talking to him a
curious and exciting thing happened. A
message began to tick off on the telegraph
machine. Mr. Verney was just turning to
go away when Mr. Ward called out, “Stop
a minute, please! This message is for
Miss Stavely.”</p>

<p>Mary ran over to the machine and
stood by Mr. Ward while he wrote down
the message which the little needle ticked
out. She had never had a telegram
before, and to have one like this—“warm
from the cow,” as Mr. Ward said—was
splendid. Mr. Ward handed it to her at
last.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mary Stavely, Mercombe.</span></p>

<p>“How is the almoning? I want
to pay all extra expenses.—<span class="smcap">Uncle Herbert.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>The reply was paid; but Mary had to
write it out several times before it satisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
her and came within the sixpence. This
was what she said:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Stavely, Reform Club, London.</span></p>

<p>“All right. Will send accounts.
Expenses small.—<span class="smcap">Mary.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>On the way home they spoke to Fraser,
who let out carriages and carts. Fraser
liked the plan as much as every one else
did. He promised to call in on the
Snellings in a casual way, on the morning
on which they would receive the tickets,
and suggest to them that they should let
him drive them to the station and bring
them home again. When Mary offered
to pay him, Mr. Fraser said no, certainly
not; he would like to help her. He
hadn’t done anything for anybody for so
long that he should be interested in seeing
what it felt like. This meant a saving of
four shillings.</p>

<p>Mary went to tea at Mr. Verney’s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
After tea he printed addresses on a number
of envelopes, and put the postal orders inside,
with a little card in each, on which
he printed the words, “From a friend, for
Tommy to go to the sea-side home for a
fortnight”; “From a friend, for Mr. and
Mrs. Snelling to go to London”; “From
a friend, for Mr. Eyles’ spectacles,” and so
forth, and then he stamped them and stuck
them down, and put them all into a big
envelope, which he posted to his sister in
Ireland, so that when they came back they
all had the Dublin postmark, and no one
ever saw such puzzled and happy people
as the recipients were.</p>

<p>“Has your mother any friends in
Dublin, Miss Mary?” Mrs. Snelling asked
a day or so later, in the midst of a conversation
about sweet peas.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mary. It was not until
afterwards that she saw what Mrs. Snelling
meant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span></p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Next Thursday came at last, the day
on which Thomas Barnes’ shed was to be
anti-burgled. At ten o’clock, having had
leave to stay up late on this great occasion,
Mary put on her things, and Mr. Verney,
who had come to dinner, took her to his
rooms. There, in the outhouse which he
used for a studio, he showed her the truck.</p>

<p>“And here,” he said, “is my secret,”
pointing out the words—</p>

<p class="center"><span class="indentright">THOMAS BARNES,</span><br>
<span class="indentleft2">PORTER, MERCOMBE.</span></p>

<p>which he had painted in white letters on
the side.</p>

<p>“He’s bound to keep it now, whatever
happens,” Mr. Verney said. “In order
to make as little noise as possible to-night,”
he added, “I have wrapped felt round the
tyres.”</p>

<p>He then took a bag from the shelf,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
placed it on the barrow, and they stole
out. Mr. Verney’s landlady had gone to
bed, and there was no sound of anyone
in the village. The truck made no
noise.</p>

<p>After half a mile they came to the
cross-roads where Thomas Barnes’ cottage
stood, and Mr. Verney walked to the
house and knocked loudly.</p>

<p>There was no answer. Indeed, he
had not expected one, but he wished
to make sure that Thomas had not
returned from Westerfield sooner than he
should.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he whispered. “Now
for the anti-burgling.”</p>

<p>He wheeled the truck to the side
of the gate leading to the shed, and,
taking the bag, they passed through.
Mr. Verney opened the bag and took
out a lantern, a hammer, and a screw-driver.</p>

<p>“We must get this padlock off,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
said, and while Mary held the lantern he
worked away at the fastenings. It was
more difficult than he expected, especially
as he did not want to break anything, but
to put it back exactly as it had been.
Several minutes passed.</p>

<p>“There,” he cried; “that’s it.”</p>

<p>At the same moment a sound of
heavy footsteps was heard, and Mary
gave a little scream and dropped the
lantern.</p>

<p>A strong hand gripped her arm.</p>

<p>“Hullo! Hullo!” said a gruff
voice. “What’s this? Housebreaking,
indeed!”</p>

<p>Mr. Verney had stooped for the lantern,
and as he rose the policeman—for he it
was—seized him also.</p>

<p>“You’d better come along with me,”
the policeman said, “and make no trouble
about it. The less trouble you make, the
easier it’ll be for you before the magistrates.”</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_162_facing">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">WHILE MARY HELD THE LANTERN, HE WORKED AWAY AT
THE FASTENINGS.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“But look here,” Mr. Verney said,
“you’re making a mistake. We’re not
housebreaking.”</p>

<p>The policeman laughed. “Now, that’s
a good’un,” he said. “Dark lantern,
screw-driver, hammer, eleven o’clock at
night, Thomas Barnes’ shed—and you’re
not housebreaking! Perhaps you’ll tell
me what you are doing, you and your
audacious female accomplice here. Playing
hide-and-seek, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Verney, suddenly
striking a match with his free hand, and
holding it up so that the light fell full on
his own and on Mary’s face, “we’ll tell
you the whole story.”</p>

<p>“Miss Stavely!” cried the policeman,
“and Mr. Verney. Well, this is a start.
But what does it all mean?”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Verney told the story, first
making Dobbs promise not to tell it
again.</p>

<p>The policeman grew more and more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
interested as it went on. Finally he exclaimed:
“You get the door open, sir,
and I’ll fetch the truck through. Time’s
getting along.”</p>

<p>He hurried out of the yard and returned
carrying the truck on his shoulders.
Then he stripped off the felt with his
knife and ran it into the shed, beside the
old broken-down barrow that had done
service for so many years.</p>

<p>Mr. Verney soon had the padlock back
in its place as if nothing had happened,
and after carefully gathering up the felt
they hurried off, in order to get home
before Thomas Barnes should call with
the medicine that he had been sent to
buy.</p>

<p>“Let me carry the bag, sir,” the policeman
said.</p>

<p>“What, full of burgling tools!” said
Mr. Verney.</p>

<p>“Mum’s the word,” the policeman
replied, “mum’s the word.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>At the forge cottage he wished them
good-night.</p>

<p>“Then you don’t want us in court to-morrow?”
Mr. Verney asked.</p>

<p>“Mum’s the word,” was all that Dobbs
replied, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>Thomas Barnes’ train being late, Mary
did not get to bed until after twelve that
night. She laid her head on the pillow
with particular satisfaction, for the last and
most difficult part of the distribution of
Uncle Herbert’s money was over.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>The next day Mary sent Uncle Herbert
a long description of her duties as his
almoner, and enclosed the account. What
with postages and her railway fare, she
had spent altogether £4. 18s. 11d.</p>

<p>Two days later this letter came back
from Uncle Herbert:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Mary</span>,</p>

<p>“You are as good an almoner as I
could wish, and I hope that another
chance of setting you to work will come.
Put the thirteen pence that are over in a
box labelled ‘The Almoner’s Fund.’
Then take the enclosed postal order for a
pound and get it cashed, and the next
time you are in Westerfield buy Mr.
Verney a box of cigarettes, but be sure to
find out first what kind he likes. Also give
Harry six shillings. I dare say he has
broken his bicycle or wants some more
films: at any rate, he will not say no.
The rest is for yourself to buy something
purely for yourself with. Please
tell your mother that I am coming on
Saturday by the train reaching you at
5.8. I shall walk from the station, but
I want Thomas Barnes to fetch my
bag.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Your affectionate</span><br>
“<span class="smcap">Uncle Herbert</span>.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>Whether or no Thomas Barnes knew
where the truck came from we never
found out; but at Christmas-time he was
discovered among the waits who sang carols
on the Stavelys’ lawn.</p>

</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a very rich
gentleman named Sir Franklin Ingleside,
who lived all alone in a beautiful house in
Berkeley Square. He was so rich that he
could not possibly spend more than a little
of his money, although he gave great sums
away, and had horses and carriages, and
bought old pictures and new books.</p>

<p>He lived very quietly, rode a little,
drove a little, called on old friends (chiefly
old ladies), usually dined alone, and afterwards
read by the fire.</p>

<p>Although the house was large and full
of servants, all Sir Franklin’s wants were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
supplied by his own particular man,
Pembroke. Pembroke was clean-shaven,
very neat, spoke quietly, and never grew
any older or seemed ever to have been any
younger. It was impossible to think of
Pembroke as a baby, or a boy, or a person
with a Christian name. One could think
of him only as a grave man named
Pembroke. No one ever saw him smile
in Berkeley Square, but a page boy once
came home with the news that he had
passed Mr. Pembroke talking to a man in
the street at Islington, and heard him laugh
out loud. But page boys like inventing
impossible stories, and making your flesh
creep.</p>

<p>Pembroke lived in a little room communicating
by bells with all the rooms
which Sir Franklin used; so that whenever
the bell rang Pembroke knew exactly
where his master was. Pembroke did not
seem to have any life but his master’s;
and the one thing about which he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
always thinking was how to know beforehand
exactly what his master wanted.
Pembroke became so clever at this that he
would often, after being rung for, enter
the room carrying the very thing that
Sir Franklin was going to request him to
get.</p>

<p>Sir Franklin once asked him how he
did it, and Pembroke said that he did not
know; but part of the secret was explained
that very year quite by chance. It was
like this. In the autumn Sir Franklin and
Pembroke always went to Scotland, and
that year when they were in Scotland the
Berkeley Square house was done up and
all the old pull-bells were taken away and
new electric ones were put in instead.
When Sir Franklin came back again he
noticed that Pembroke was not nearly so
clever in anticipating needs as he had been
before; and when he asked him about it,
Pembroke said: “My opinion, sir, is that
it’s all along of the bells. The new bells,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
which you press, ring the same, however
you press them, and startle a body too,
whereas the old bells, which you used to
pull, sir, told me what you wanted by the
way you pulled them, and never startled
one at all.”</p>

<p>So Sir Franklin and Pembroke went to
Paris for a week while the new press bells
were taken away and the old pull-bells put
back again, and then Pembroke became
again just as clever as before. (But that
was, of course, only part of the secret.)</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>It was at a quarter to nine on the evening
of December 18, 1907, that Sir Franklin,
who was sitting by the fire reading and
thinking, suddenly got up and rang the
bell.</p>

<p>Pembroke came in at once and said,
“I’m sorry you’re troubled in your mind,
sir. Perhaps I can be of some assistance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“I’m afraid not,” said Sir Franklin.
“But do you know what day this is?”</p>

<p>“We are nearing the end of December
18,” said Pembroke.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sir Franklin, “and what is
a week to-day?”</p>

<p>“A week to-day, sir,” said Pembroke,
“is Christmas Day.”</p>

<p>“And what about children who won’t
get any presents this Christmas?” Sir
Franklin asked.</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed, sir,” said Pembroke.</p>

<p>“And what about people in trouble,
Pembroke?” Sir Franklin asked.</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed, sir,” said Pembroke.</p>

<p>“And that reminds me,” Pembroke
added after a pause, “that I was going to
speak to you about the cook’s brother-in-law,
sir: a worthy man, sir, but in
difficulties.”</p>

<p>Sir Franklin asked for particulars.</p>

<p>“He keeps a toy-shop, sir, in London,
and he can’t make it pay. He’s tried and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
tried, but there’s no money in toys in his
neighbourhood—except penny toys, on
which the margin of profit is, I am told,
sir, very small.”</p>

<p>Sir Franklin poked the fire and looked
into it for a little while. Then, “It seems
to me, Pembroke,” he said, “that the
cook’s brother-in-law’s difficulties and the
little matter of the children can be solved
in the same action. Why shouldn’t we
take over the toy-shop and let the children
into it on Christmas Eve to choose what
they will?”</p>

<p>Pembroke stroked his chin for a
moment and then said, “The very thing,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Where does the cook’s brother-in-law
live?” Sir Franklin asked.</p>

<p>Pembroke gave the address.</p>

<p>“Then if you’ll call a hansom, Pembroke,
we’ll drive there at once.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>It does not matter at all about the visit
which Sir Franklin Ingleside and Pembroke
paid to the cook’s brother-in-law.
All that need be said is that the cook’s
brother-in-law was quite willing to sell
Sir Franklin his stock-in-trade and to
make the shop over to him, and Sir
Franklin Ingleside rode back to Berkeley
Square not only a gentleman who had
horses and carriages and who bought old
pictures and new books, but perhaps the
first gentleman in Berkeley Square to
have a toy-shop too.</p>

<p>On the way back he talked to Pembroke
about his plans.</p>

<p>“There’s a kind of child, Pembroke,”
said Sir Franklin, “that I particularly
want to encourage and reward. It is
clear that we can’t give presents to all;
and I don’t want the greedy ones and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
strongest ones to be as fortunate as the
modest ones and the weak ones. So my
plan is, first of all to make sure that the
kind of child that I have in mind is properly
looked after, and then to give the
others what remains. And the particular
children I mean are the little girls who
take care of their younger brothers and
sisters while their parents are busy, and
who go to the shops and stalls and do the
marketing. Whenever I see one I always
say to myself, ‘There goes a Little
Mother!’ and it is the Little Mothers
whom this Christmas we must particularly
help.</p>

<p>“Now what you must do, Pembroke,
during the next few days, is to make a
list of the streets in every direction within
a quarter of a mile of the toy-shop, and
then find out, from the schoolmistresses,
and the butchers, and the publicans’ wives,
and the grocers, and the oil-shops, and
the greengrocers, and the more talkative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
women on the doorsteps, which are the
best Little Mothers in the district and
what is the size of their families, and get
their names and addresses. And then we
shall know what to do.”</p>

<p>By this time the cab had reached
Berkeley Square again, and Sir Franklin
returned to his books.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The next few days were the busiest and
most perplexing that Pembroke ever spent.
He was in Clerkenwell, where the toy-shop
was situated, from morning till night.
He bought all kinds of things that he did
not want—cheese and celery, mutton-chops
and beer, butter and paraffin—just
to get on terms with the people who
know about the Little Mothers.</p>

<p>Although naturally rather silent and reserved,
he talked to butchers and bakers
and women on doorsteps, and schoolmistresses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span> 
and even hot-potato men, as
if they were the best company in the
world, and bit by bit he made a list of
twenty-two Little Mothers of first-class
merit, and fifty-one of second-class merit,
and all their children.</p>

<p>Having got these down in his book,
Pembroke was going home on the evening
of the 21st very well pleased with himself
on the whole, but still feeling that Sir
Franklin would be disappointed not to
have the name of the best Little Mother
of all, when an odd thing happened. He
had stopped in a doorway not very far
from the toy-shop, to light his pipe, when
he heard a shrill voice saying very decidedly,
“Very well, then, William
Kitchener Beacon, if that’s your determination
you shall stay here all night,
and by and by the rats will come out and
bite you.”</p>

<p>Pembroke stood still and listened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe45_1875" id="i_181_facing">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_181_facing.jpg" alt="A LITTLE PROCESSION PASSED THE DOORWAY">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">A LITTLE PROCESSION PASSED THE DOORWAY.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“I don’t want to go home,” a childish
voice whimpered. “I want to look in the
shops.”</p>

<p>“Come home you must and shall,” said
the other. “Here’s Lucy tired out, and
Amy crying, and John cold to his very
marrer, and Tommy with a sawreel, and
father’ll want his dinner, and mother’ll
think we’re all run over by a motor-car;
and come home you must and shall.”</p>

<p>Sounds of a scuffle followed, and then a
little procession passed the doorway. First
came a sturdy little girl of about ten,
carrying a huge string-basket filled with
heavy things, and pulling behind her by
the other hand a small and sulky boy,
whom Pembroke took to be William
Kitchener Beacon. Then came the others,
and lastly Tommy, limping with the sore
heel.</p>

<p>Pembroke stopped the girl with the
bag, and asked her if she lived far away,
and finding that it was close to the toy-shop,
he said he should like to carry the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
bag, and help the family home. He was
not allowed to carry the bag, but no objection
was raised to his lifting Tommy
on his back, and they all went home
together.</p>

<p>On the way he discovered that the
Little Mother was named Matilda Beacon,
and that she lived at 28, Pulvercake
Buildings, Clerkenwell.</p>

<p>She was nine years old, an age when
most of you are still running to your nurses
to have this and that done for you. But
Matilda, in addition to doing everything
for herself very quietly and well, had also
to do most things for her mother, who
went out charing every day, except Sunday,
and for her brothers and sisters, of
whom she had five—three brothers aged
seven, six, and three, and two sisters, who
were twins and both five. Matilda got
them up and put them to bed; picked
them up when they fell, and dried their
tears; separated them when they quarrelled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
which was very often; bought their
food and cooked it, and gave it to them,
and saw that they did not eat too fast; and
was, in short, the absolute mistress of the
very tiny flat where the Beacons lived.</p>

<p>Mr. Beacon worked on the line at
St. Pancras, and if he was late home, as
he very often was, Mrs. Beacon was always
sure that he had been run over by a passing
train and cut into several pieces; so that
in addition to all her other work Matilda
had also to comfort her mother.</p>

<p>The next day, when he came again to
the toy-shop district, Pembroke was
delighted to find that by general consent
Matilda Beacon was considered to be the
best Little Mother in Clerkenwell; but
who do you think came next in public
opinion? Not Carrie Tompsett, although
she had several strong backers; and not
Lou Miller, although she had her supporters
too, and was really a very good
little thing, with an enormous family on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
her hands. No, it was neither of these.
Indeed, it was not a Little Mother at all,
so I don’t see how you could have guessed.
It was a “Little Father.” It was generally
agreed by the butchers and bakers and
oilmen and hot-potato men and publicans
and the women on the doorsteps, that the
best Little Mother next to Matilda Beacon
was Artie Gillam, who, since his mother
had died last year and his father had not
yet married again, had the charge of four
sisters and two brothers.</p>

<p>All these things Pembroke reported to
his master; and Sir Franklin was so much
interested in hearing about Matilda Beacon
that he told Pembroke to arrange so that
Mrs. Beacon might stay at home one day
and let Matilda come to see him. So
Matilda put on her best hat and came
down from Clerkenwell to Berkeley
Square on the blue bus that runs between
Highbury and Walham Green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span></p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>When the splendid great door was opened
by a tall and handsome footman Matilda
clung to Pembroke as if he were her only
friend in the world, as, indeed, he really
seemed to be at that moment in that house.
She had never seen anything so grand
before; and after all, it is rather striking for
a little girl of nine who has all her life
been managing a large family in two small
rooms in Clerkenwell, to be brought
suddenly into a mansion in Berkeley Square
to speak to a gentleman with a title. Not
that a gentleman with a title is necessarily
any more dreadful than a policeman; but
Matilda knew several policemen quite
intimately, and was, therefore, no longer
afraid of them, although she still found
their terribleness useful when her little
brothers and sisters were naughty. “I’ll
fetch a policeman to you!” she used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
say, and sometimes actually would go
downstairs a little way to do so and come
back stamping her feet; and this always
had the effect of making them good again.</p>

<p>Sir Franklin was sitting in the library
with a tea-table by his side set for two,
and directly Matilda had dared to shake
his hand he told Pembroke to bring the
tea.</p>

<p>Matilda could not take her eyes from
the shelves of books which ran all round
the room. She did not quite know whether
it might not be a book-shop and Sir Franklin
a grand kind of bookseller; and then she
looked at the walls and wondered if it was
a picture-shop; and she made a note in her
mind to ask Mr. Pembroke.</p>

<p>Her thoughts were brought back by
Pembroke bringing in a silver tea-pot and
silver kettle, which he placed over a spirit
lamp; and then Sir Franklin asked her if
she took sugar.</p>

<p>(If she took sugar? What a question!)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>She said, “Yes, please, sir,” very nicely,
and Sir Franklin handed her the basin.</p>

<p>Would she have bread and butter or
cake? he asked next.</p>

<p>(Or cake? What a question again!)</p>

<p>She said she would like cake, and she
watched very carefully to see how Sir
Franklin ate his, and at first did the same;
but when after two very small bites he
laid it down and did not pick it up again,
Matilda very sensibly ceased to copy
him.</p>

<p>When they had finished tea and had
talked about various things that did not
matter, Sir Franklin asked her suddenly,
“How would you like to keep shop,
Matilda?”</p>

<p>Matilda gasped. “What sort of a shop?”
she asked at last.</p>

<p>“A toy-shop,” said Sir Franklin.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I couldn’t,” she said.</p>

<p>“Only for one day,” Sir Franklin
added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>“One day!” Her eager eyes glistened.
“But what about Tommy and Willy and
the twins?”</p>

<p>“Your mother would stay at home that
day and look after them. That could
easily be arranged.</p>

<p>“You see,” Sir Franklin went on, “I
want to give all the children in your street
and in several other streets near it a
Christmas present, and it is thought that
the best way is to open a toy-shop for the
purpose. But it is necessary that the toy-shop
keeper should know most of the
children and should be a capable woman
of business, and that is why I ask you.
The salary will be a sovereign; the hours
will be from two to eight, with an interval
for tea; and you shall have Mr. Pembroke
to help you.”</p>

<p>Matilda did not know how to keep still,
and yet there was the least shade of disappointment,
or at least perplexity, on her
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“Is it all right?” Sir Franklin asked.</p>

<p>“Ye-e-s,” said Matilda.</p>

<p>“Nothing you want to say?”</p>

<p>“No-o-o,” said Matilda; “I don’t
think so.”</p>

<p>And yet it was very clear that something
troubled her a little.</p>

<p>Sir Franklin was so puzzled by it that
he went out to consult Pembroke. Pembroke
explained the matter in a moment.</p>

<p>“I ought to have said,” Sir Franklin
remarked at once on returning, “that the
shopkeeper, although a capable business
woman, may play at being a little girl,
too, if she likes, and will find a doll and a
work-basket for herself, and even sweets
too, just like the others.”</p>

<p>Matilda’s face at once became nothing
but smiles.</p>

<p>“You will want a foreman,” Sir Franklin
then said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Matilda, who would have
said yes to anything by this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“Well, who will you have?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think Tommy would do,”
said Matilda. “He’s that thoughtless.
And Willy’s too small.”</p>

<p>“How about Frederick?” said Sir
Franklin, ringing the bell twice.</p>

<p>Matilda sat still and waited, wondering
who Frederick was.</p>

<p>After a moment or two the door opened,
and a very smart boy, all over buttons,
came in. “You can take away the tea-things,”
said Sir Franklin.</p>

<p>“That was Frederick,” said Sir Franklin,
when the boy had gone.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Matilda.</p>

<p>“Would he do for foreman?” Sir
Franklin asked.</p>

<p>Matilda hesitated. She would have
preferred some one she knew, but she did
not like to say so.</p>

<p>“Too buttony?” suggested Sir Franklin.</p>

<p>Matilda agreed.</p>

<p>“Then,” said Sir Franklin, “is there
anyone you know?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“I think Artie Gillam——” said
Matilda.</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said Sir Franklin,
“it shall be Artie Gillam. His wages
will be ten shillings.”</p>

<p>And thus everything was settled, and
Matilda was sent home with Frederick
the page boy, the happiest and most
responsible Little Mother in London, with
an armful of good things for the family.</p>

<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Meanwhile Pembroke had been to
Houndsditch buying quantities of new
toys: for every Little Mother a large doll
and a work-basket, and smaller dolls and
other toys for the others, together with
sweets and oranges and all kinds of other
things, and everything was ready by the
day before Christmas Eve, and all the
tickets were distributed.</p>

<p>The tickets were Pembroke’s idea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
because one difficulty about opening a
free toy-shop in a poor district of London
for one day only is that even the invited
children, not having had your opportunities
of being brought up nicely and learning
good manners, are apt to push and struggle
to get in out of their turn, and perhaps
even to try to get in twice, while there
would be trouble, too, from the children
who did not belong to the district. Pembroke
knew this, and thought a good deal
about the way to manage it so that there
should be no crowding or difficulty. In
the end Sir Franklin engaged a large hall,
to which all the children were to come
with their tickets, and from this hall they
were to visit the shop in little companies
of ten, make their choice of toys, and then
go straight home. Of course, a certain
number of other children would gather
round the shop, but that could not be
helped, and perhaps at the close of the
afternoon, when all the others had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
looked after, they might be let in to choose
what was left. And in this state were the
things the night before Christmas Eve.</p>

<h3>VII</h3>

<p>Pembroke managed everything so well
that the great day went off without a
hitch. At half-past two the Little Mothers
with their families began to arrive, and
they were sent off to the shop in companies
of ten or thereabouts, two or three families
at once. A couple of friendly policemen
kept the crowd away from the shop, so
that the children had plenty of time and
quiet to choose what they wanted.</p>

<p>All the Little Mothers, as I have said,
had each a doll and a work-basket; but
the younger children might make their
choice of two things each, and take two
things for any little brother or sister who
could not come—Clerkenwell being full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
of little boys and girls who are not very
well.</p>

<p>When they were chosen, Artie Gillam
wrapped them up, and off the children
went to make room for others.</p>

<p>Matilda was a splendid shopkeeper.
She helped the smaller children to choose
things in a way that might be a real lesson
to real keepers of toy-shops, who always
seem tired.</p>

<p>“Now then, Lizzie Hatchett,” she
said, “you don’t want that jack-in-the-box.
What’s the good of a jack-in-the-box
to you if your brother’s got one?
One in a family’s plenty. Better have
this parasol: it lasts longer and is much
more useful.</p>

<p>“Here’s a nice woolly lamb for Jenny
Rogers’s baby brother,” she cried, taking
away a monkey on a stick. “He’ll only
suck the paint off that and be deathly ill.</p>

<p>“Now, Tommy Williams, don’t bother
about those ninepins. Here’s a clockwork<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
mouse I’ve been keeping for you.” And
so on. Matilda’s bright, quick eyes were
everywhere.</p>

<p>Only one or two uninvited children
squeezed in with the others. One of
these was a very determined little rascal,
who actually got in twice. The first time
he went away not only with toys of his
own, but with something for a quite
imaginary brother with whooping-cough.
This made him so bold that he hurried
away and fought another little boy in the
next street and took away his coat and
cap. The coat was red and the cap had
flaps for the ears, so that they made him
look quite different. Wearing these, he
managed to mix with the next little party
coming from the hall. But he had forgotten
one thing, and that was that the
little boy whom he had fought was Artie
Gillam’s cousin. Artie at once recognized
both the cap and the coat, and told Mr.
Pembroke, and Mr. Pembroke told one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
the policemen, who marched into the shop,
looking exceedingly fierce, and seizing the
interloper by the arm, asked him whose
coat he had on. At this the boy began
to cry, and said he would never do it
again. But it was too late. The policeman
took hold of his wrist and marched
him out of the shop and through all the
other children in the street, who followed
them in a procession, to the home of
Artie’s cousin, and there he had to give
back the coat. Then he was allowed to
go, because Artie’s cousin’s father was out,
and Artie’s cousin’s mother (who was
Artie’s aunt) was not at all the kind of
woman to thrash little boys.</p>

<p>So the time went on until all the children
in Pembroke’s list had got their toys and
the hall was empty, and then the many
others who had been waiting outside were
let in, one by one, until all the toys were
gone, and the policemen sent the rest away.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Pembroke, “we must shut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
the shop.” So Artie Gillam went outside
and put up the shutters, and Matilda put
on her jacket and hat.</p>

<p>Then Pembroke took some money out
of his pocket to pay the manager and her
foreman their salaries.</p>

<p>“How will you have it?” he said to
Matilda.</p>

<p>“Please I don’t know what you mean,”
Matilda replied.</p>

<p>“Gold or silver?” Pembroke explained.</p>

<p>Matilda had never seen gold yet, except
in jewellers’ windows. Her mother’s
wedding-ring was silver. “Oh, gold,
please,” she gasped.</p>

<p>“One sovereign or two halves?” Pembroke
asked.</p>

<p>“Two halves,” Matilda said.</p>

<p>Pembroke gave them to her.</p>

<p>Artie Gillam, on the other hand, wanted
his ten shillings in as many coins as he
could have, and his pocket was quite
heavy with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>“And now,” said Pembroke, “I suppose
you’re going home. Be careful of your
money on the way.”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Matilda, “I’m not going
home yet. I’ve got some shopping to do.”</p>

<p>“To-morrow’s dinner?” Pembroke suggested.</p>

<p>“No,” said Matilda mysteriously.
“That’s all bought. Father won a goose
in the Goose Club.”</p>

<p>“Then what are you going to buy?”
Pembroke asked, for he wished to take as
long and full a story home to Sir Franklin
as might be.</p>

<p>“I’m going shopping for myself,” said
Matilda. “I’m going to buy some
Christmas presents.”</p>

<p>“May I come with you?” Pembroke
asked.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, please, I want you to. I’m
only going to spend one of these half-sovereigns.
The other I shall put away.
But I must buy something for mother, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
something for father, and I want to buy
something else, too, for somebody else.”</p>

<p>So Pembroke and Matilda and Artie,
having turned out the gas and locked up
the shop, which, however, now contained
nothing whatever but paper and string and
straw, walked off to the shops.</p>

<p>They first went into a draper’s, where
Matilda looked at some shawls and bought
a nice thick woollen one for her mother,
and also a pair of grey wool mittens for
her father. These came to five-and-six.</p>

<p>Then they went to an ironmonger’s and
bought a cover for a plate to keep things
warm, which Matilda said was for her
father’s dinner, because he was often late
while her mother thought he was being
cut in pieces. This cost ninepence.</p>

<p>Then they went to a tobacconist’s and
bought a pipe with a silver band on it,
and two ounces of tobacco. These came
to one-and-fourpence and were also for
her father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>Then they went to a china-shop and
bought a hot-water bottle for a shilling.
“That,” said Matilda, “is for the old
woman next door to us, who nursed
mother when she was ill. She can’t sleep
at night because her feet are so cold.”</p>

<p>“And now,” said Pembroke, “it’s my
turn,” and he took the children into a
greengrocer’s shop and bought a shilling’s
worth of holly and mistletoe for each of
them. “If you like,” he said, “I will
carry this home for you.”</p>

<p>Matilda thanked him very heartily, but
said that she still had one more present she
must buy, and led the way to a little fancy
shop, kept by an old maid.</p>

<p>“Please,” said Matilda, “I want a kettle-holder.”</p>

<p>The old lady took out a drawer and laid
it on the counter. It was full of kettle-holders,
some made in wool-work, others
in patch-work. Matilda looked at them
very carefully one by one, and at last chose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
one in scarlet and bright yellow wool-work.
When it was done up in a neat
little packet and she had paid for it—sixpence—she
handed it to Pembroke.</p>

<p>“That,” she said, “is a present for the
gentleman. When I had tea with him I
noticed that he hadn’t got one, and of
course every family ought to have a kettle-holder.
I should have liked to make one
for him myself, but there hasn’t been
time.”</p>

<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>Sir Franklin Ingleside did not use the
kettle-holder. He hung it on a nail by
the fire-place, and whenever he is asked
about it, or people smile at its very striking
colours, he says, “I value that very
highly; that is the profit that I made out
of a toy-shop which I once kept.”</p>

<small>THE STORY OF SPEKE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Kensington Gardens, close to Lancaster
Gate, there rises from the grass beside the
path leading direct to “Physical Energy”
a column of red granite, bearing the words
“In Memory of Speke. Victoria Nyanza
and the Nile. 1864.” Anyone curious
enough to stand for a while near this
column and listen to the nurses and
children who pass would hear some strange
suggestions as to why the column is there,
and who or what Speke was; but for the
most part the answer to the question is:
“I don’t know,” or, “How should I
know?” or, “Inquire of your pa”; or, by
the more daring, “Speke was a great man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>“Yes, but what kind of a great man?
What did he do?”</p>

<p>“Do? Oh! [airily] he did great things.
That’s why he has a monument—monuments
are put up only to great men.”</p>

<p>“Yes, nurse, but do tell me what Speke
did?”</p>

<p>“That I shan’t now. I might have
done if you hadn’t worried me so. But
I’ll tell you what he didn’t do: he didn’t
ask questions all day long. No great man
ever did.”</p>

<p>That evening, perhaps, just before bedtime,
the same question will be repeated
at home.</p>

<p>“Father, who is Speke?”</p>

<p>“Speke?”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s a monument in the Gardens
in memory of Speke.”</p>

</figure>

<p>“A very unsuitable inscription, I think.
Bad advice. Little boys—yes, and little
girls too—should be seen and not heard.
I would rather it said ‘In honour of not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
speaking.’” (This father, you see, was one
of the funny fathers who think that
children want only to laugh.)</p>

<p>“No, father, not <span class="smcap">S-p-e-a-k</span>; <span class="smcap">S-p-e-k-e</span>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Speke!—yes, of course, well,
Speke—Speke was a great man.”</p>

<p>“Nurse said that, father. But what did
he do?”</p>

<p>“Do? Oh, he was a great, great
Englishman! A very noble life. That’s
why he has a monument. Monuments,
you know, are raised only to the great.
You have seen the Albert Memorial, and
the statue of the Duke of Wellington
at Hyde Park Corner?”</p>

<p>“Yes, father, but do tell me what Speke
did?”</p>

<p>“Speke—my dear child, do you know
what the time is? It’s twenty to eight.
You ought to have been upstairs for ten
minutes. Good-night. Sleep well.”</p>

<p>The result is that for several years the
children of Bayswater and Kensington have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
had to invent stories of Speke for themselves.
They know in a vague way that
he was a traveller, because of the other
words on the monument; but that is all.
They don’t know whether he was young or
old; whether he travelled in 1864, or died
in 1864. Some of them, the smaller ones,
connecting Victoria Nyanza in some way
with Queen Victoria, think of Speke as
something to do with Kensington Gardens—perhaps
he was the head gardener, they
think, or the man who planted the trees.
To others the word Nile on the column
suggests thoughts of Moses in the bulrushes,
and Pharaoh and the Israelites.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, who was Speke?</p>

<p>I will tell you.</p>

<p>John Hanning Speke was born on
May 4, 1827, at Jordans, near Ilchester,
in Somersetshire. That was the year
when it was first observed that Englishmen
walked with their hands in
their pockets. Speke’s father was a captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
in the 14th Dragoons, and the son
was brought up to be a soldier too; and
in 1844, when he was seventeen, he
entered the army, and went to the Punjab
in India, where he fought in several battles
and became a lieutenant. Any time he
could get from active service he spent in
exploring the Himalayas and in hunting
wild beasts and looking for rare plants and
fossils.</p>

<p>In 1854, when his ten years in India
were over, he went to Africa in order to
carry out his pet scheme of exploring the
centre of that Continent, which was then
almost unknown. Before, however, he
could get to work properly the Crimean
War broke out, and he at once volunteered
for service there and fought very gallantly;
and then, in 1856, he really began again
upon Africa in earnest, in company with
another intrepid traveller, Sir Richard
Burton, the wonderful man who made
the pilgrimage to Mecca disguised so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
cleverly as a Mohamedan that he was
not discovered. Had he been he would
have been killed at once.</p>

<p>The particular ambition of Burton and
Speke was to trace the river Nile back to
its source in the mysterious heart of the
Mountains of the Moon.</p>

<p>Has it ever occurred to you that every
river has a source—that every river begins
somewhere, in a tiny spring? Few forms
of exploration are more interesting than
to trace a stream back to its first drop.
The Thames, for example, begins in the
Cotswold Hills—the merest little trickle.
All running water, you know, sooner or
later reaches the sea. That little trickle
in the Cotswolds will in time glide past
Henley and Hampton Court and Westminster
Bridge, and past the Tower, and
help to bear up the thousands of vessels in
the Port of London, and at last will run
out into the sea at Gravesend. Some day
perhaps you will walk up the banks of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
the Upper Thames until you come to the
Cotswold spring.</p>

<p>But of course a river, although we speak
of its having one source, has others too.
Many streams run into the Thames, and
each of these has also its source. There is
one, indeed, close to Speke’s monument—the
Westbourne, which gives its name to
Westbourne Grove, where Whiteley’s is.
The West Bourne, like all the little London
rivers, now runs underground, but it used
to be open a hundred and more years ago.
The West Bourne rises near the Finchley
Road Station, and has many adventures
before it reaches the Thames and the sea.
It runs, I have been told, under the Bayswater
Road into the Serpentine. At the
bottom of the Serpentine it comes out
again in a waterfall, where the rabbits
are, and again runs underground to the
King’s garden at the back of Buckingham
Palace, where it reappears as a beautiful
lake. Then it dives under the Palace and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
comes up again as the water in St. James’s
Park, where all the interesting water-fowl
live and have nests on an island—the ducks
and gulls and cormorants and penguins.
Then, once more, it disappears, this time
under the Horse Guards and Whitehall,
and comes out into the Thames. Not a
bad career for a little bit of a stream rising
at Hampstead, is it?</p>

<p>To explore that stream would be fairly
easy, and it is not difficult to explore the
Thames. But in order to realize quite
what Speke did you must think for a
moment of what it means to travel in unexplored
countries. There are no maps:
you have no notion what is before you;
the natives may be suspicious of you and
make war at once, or they may at first
pretend to be friendly and then suddenly
attempt a massacre; fever is always on
your track; wild beasts may be in such
numbers as to be a continual danger. It
is a great thing to dare all these known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
and unknown perils just to do—what?
To make a fortune? No. To add a
country to England’s possessions? No.
But just to gain a little more knowledge
of geography; just to add one more fact
to the world’s sum.</p>

<p>Illness came to both explorers, and they
endured very severe privations, and at last
Burton had to give up and allow Speke to
go on alone. They parted at Kazé on
July 9, 1858, just fifty years ago, Speke
setting out with thirty-five native followers
and supplies for six weeks. On August 3
he discovered a gigantic lake, to which he
gave the name Victoria Nyanza—Victoria
after his Queen, and Nyanza meaning a
piece of water.</p>

<p>You should now get your atlas and look
for the Nile and Kazé and the vast lake,
where, as Speke then thought, and as is
now known, the river Nile begins its
course of three thousand four hundred
miles, which does not end until, after passing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
through Khartoum, and Dongola, and
Wady Halfa, and Assouan, and Thebes,
and Ghizeh, and Cairo, it glides into the
sea by the many mouths of its delta at
Rosetta and Damietta and Alexandria.</p>

<p>Speke then returned to England, to tell
his countrymen all about his discovery, and
in 1860 he set out for Africa again, and
began a series of very tedious and harassing
marches from Zanzibar through Uganda
to reach Victoria Nyanza once more, and
explore it thoroughly. Illness again interrupted
him, and the native kings were not
wholly friendly, but at last, on July 28,
1862, he came to the head of the lake
where the water that becomes the Nile
tumbles over the edge of a cataract. This
cataract he named Ripon Falls.</p>

<p>Speke telegraphed his news to England
directly he reached a civilized town, so that
when he himself landed at Southampton, in
1863, he was received as a hero, and honours
were showered upon him, and he was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
most famous traveller of his own or almost
any other day.</p>

<p>Not every one, however (including
Burton), was satisfied that the Nile really
began at Ripon Falls, and books were
written by Burton and others in support
of rival theories. Speke, who naturally
believed himself to be right, arranged to
meet some of these other geographers in a
public discussion at Bath, in September,
1864; but on the very morning of that
day, as he was out partridge-shooting, he
accidentally shot himself and died at the
early age of thirty-seven.</p>

<p>Isn’t that a wretched way for a man to
die after braving all the perils of unknown
Africa?</p>

<p>And now, whenever you see the Speke
monument again you will think of that
great inland sea in Africa called Victoria
Nyanza, and the Nile tumbling out of it
and beginning its wonderful journey to the
Mediterranean.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A<br>
SHILLING</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Has</span> it ever occurred to you through how
many hands a piece of money passes in the
course of a day, a week, a month, and what it
does for its owners during that time? I am
fortunately in the position to be able to
tell you of the adventures of a shilling of
my acquaintance during a single day; and
the story will show you how busy a piece
of silver can be.</p>

<p>“Let me see, you want an ordinary
day,” the shilling said. “Of course, sometimes
I am not busy at all—I just lie all
the time in a till or a drawer at the Bank
(we hate being at the Bank on Sundays),
or I may belong for the time being to a
miser, or I may be locked up in a money-box.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span> 
(Children have no notion how irksome
it is to an active intelligent coin to
be put away in a dark money-box for
weeks and weeks, with no recreation but
an occasional rattle.) But I will tell you
my adventures on a rather special day on
which I not only went to church, but to a
race-meeting, and was lost into the bargain.
I was not busier then than I have been at
other times, but I had rather more ups
and downs than a day usually sees.</p>

<p>“When I woke it was quite light, and
as I lay on the dressing-table with all the
other coins the sunshine came through
the chinks of the blind and made me
pleasantly warm. Not so warm as I am in
a pocket, but still very comfortable, especially
as I had been cold in the night.</p>

<p>“It was a new room to me, and I was
very glad to see it, or, indeed, to see anything
again, since for nearly a year I had
been locked up in a little girl’s money-box,
with no one to talk to but a few low<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
pennies and a very rude little threepenny
bit, who squeaked his impertinences into
my ear all day long. Every now and
then another penny would come tumbling
in among us with a crash, sometimes
bruising us horribly, but never any real
gentlefolk, not even a sixpence. Luckily,
however, this little girl’s mother had the
sense to have a birthday, and so at last I
was taken out, to be exchanged at a
flower-shop for a pot of musk.</p>

<p>“I lay in the flower-shop till for an
hour or so, and then a nice-looking gentleman
with grey hair came in for some pink
carnations for a lady on Campden Hill,
and I was given to him as change. He
put me in his pocket, and there I remained
till he came home, when I was placed on
the dressing-table with all the other coins.</p>

<p>“I was the only shilling, the others being
a very old half-crown, quite deaf and short-tempered,
a tired florin, some more vulgar
pennies (pennies can be very coarse), and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
sovereign, who was too proud even to look
at us and at once went to sleep.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I should have
done for company had it not been for a
very affable silver-backed hair-brush on
the table close to me, who told me one
or two interesting stories of his youth and
the grand people he used to see when he
was lying in a Bond-Street window. He
was in the midst of the romance of a very
giddy tortoiseshell comb whom he had
once loved, when the gentleman got up
and began to brush his hair, and when he
set the brush down again it was too far
off for conversation. These are the little
things that human beings do not think of,
but which mean so much to us. We
always like to be put close together according
to our metal, gold near gold, silver
near silver, and so on, and we like, also, to
keep near our own values too—half-crowns
near half-crowns, and pennies near
pennies (although now and then I will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
admit I have heard some very funny and
enlightening things from copper, even
from halfpennies, although it is true that
they do drop their <i>h</i>’s and are often exceedingly
unwashed).</p>

<p>“Well, to get on with my story: when
the gentleman had finished dressing he
put us all into his pockets again and went
downstairs. Me he put in his left-hand
trouser pocket with the half-crown and
the florin; the pennies in his right, and
the sovereign in his waistcoat. And here
let me say that it is much more comfortable
to be a man’s money than a woman’s.
Men put us in their pockets and keep us
cosy: women put us in purses, where we
can hardly breathe.</p>

<p>“Directly after breakfast my gentleman
hurried off to the Notting Hill Gate
Tube station, and pushed me through a
pigeon-hole to the ticket-seller, who laid
me on the counter before him with a great
many other coins all spread out. Before,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
however, I could say anything more than
just ‘How do you do?’ to them, I was
taken up again and given in change to
another traveller.</p>

<p>“This traveller had a little boy with
him on his way back to school from
Liverpool Street, and I very nearly passed
into his possession as a tip, but just at the
last moment the traveller thought better
of it, and instead of giving the little boy a
single shilling gave him half a crown (as
all fathers and uncles ought to do at the
very least), and so I went back into his
pocket again.</p>

<p>“After the boy had gone I had a busy
two hours in the city. I was first paid
away to a ’bus conductor, and was given by
him in change to a lady on her way to a
special service at St. Paul’s. I was there
laid in a collection plate, which usually
means a long rest for us; but happily one
of the clergymen wanted a pound’s worth
of silver, and I had the luck to be among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
it. He paid me to a cabman who took
him to the Royal Academy, and by this
cabman I was soon after given as change
to a gentleman whom he drove from the
Albany to Waterloo. This gentleman
dropped me into a pocket full of money
and settled down in the corner of a railway
carriage to read the paper and smoke a
cigar.</p>

<p>“‘Do you know where we are going?’
said one of the other coins to me. ‘We
are going to the races. We may have
some fun.’</p>

<p>“This pleased me very much, for I had
never been to the races in my life, but had
heard much about them from time to
time.</p>

<p>“‘Sometimes we make a lot of money
for our master,’ the coin continued, ‘but
sometimes he loses us for ever.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ said a very fat five-shilling
piece, who was hurting me horribly by the
way he leaned against me, ‘but, of course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
you [meaning me] are too small to make
any money. It is fellows like me, and
sovereigns and half-sovereigns, that make
the money.’</p>

<p>“None the less, as it happened, I made
some too, although I had a dreadful shock
for a moment when my master gave me to
a man for a race-card, and I thought I
should never have any fun at all. Luckily,
however, the race-card man was thirsty,
and I found my way into a till, and then I
was given as change to a waiter, and soon
after realized that I was in the till of the
members’ restaurant.</p>

<p>“There, for the first time in my life, I
met a bank-note. The delicate, fragile
thing! She was very proud, but quite
affable. We call them Duchesses. You
should hear them rustle as they move!
They don’t live with us, of course; they
live in leather cases in the more fashionable
parts of the clothing, but now and
then we find ourselves in the same plate at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
restaurants, and I tell you it is a great
moment for a shilling when that happens.
How one’s heart beats! That was what
occurred on this very occasion. I went
out of the till in company with this
beautiful, refined creature, and the gentleman
to whom we were carried gave me
back to the waiter as a tip.</p>

<p>“No sooner was lunch over than the
waiter ran out on the course with me in
his hand, and went up to a man who was
standing on a box, and asked: ‘What
price Flatiron?’ and the man said, ‘Tens.’
Then the waiter handed me to the man,
and he dropped me into a bag full of other
money, both silver and gold, and gave the
waiter a ticket.</p>

<p>“‘Who are you on?’ the other coins
asked me eagerly. I had no notion what
they meant. ‘What is the name of your
horse?’ they said. This puzzled me even
more, and I said I didn’t know any names
of horses, but the waiter had asked about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
a flatiron. ‘That’s it,’ said the others;
‘that’s your horse.’ And then I found
that several others of them were there for
Flatiron’s sake too, while the others were
for other horses, such as Saucy Sally, and
Pink Pearl, and Rufus, and See-you-later.</p>

<p>“Every moment other coins came
tumbling in, and then the race began.
We could not see it, of course, but we
could hear the cries of the crowd, and we
rattled about in our excitement as the
names of our own horses reached us. At
last it was over, and we heard the man
groan out that Flatiron had won. And
very soon the waiter came for his winnings,
and a half-sovereign and I were
handed to him. I tell you I was proud
to think that I had been the means of
bringing one of those conceited half-sovereigns
to life again, but he would
not even say ‘Thank you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_229_facing">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_229_facing.jpg" alt="A BLUE RIBBON WAS THREADED THROUGH ME">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">A BLUE RIBBON WAS THREADED THROUGH ME, AND I WAS
HUNG ROUND A LITTLE GIRL’S NECK.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“The waiter spat on both of us for luck,
and put us in his pocket, and then went off
to a refreshment tent, where I was pushed
across a wet counter and again dropped
into a till, quite damp, but happily I was
taken out again before I could catch cold,
and given as change to the chauffeur of a
motor-car.</p>

<p>“Almost immediately after that the
chauffeur started his car and drove his
master back to London. I could not see
anything—a coin very rarely can—but I
felt the vibration of the engine, and every
now and then I heard the horn blow.</p>

<p>“The interesting part of the ride, however,
was the talk I had with a shilling with
a hole in it. ‘Whatever you do,’ he said,
‘don’t ever let them bore a hole in you.
Life isn’t worth living after that. It’s not so
much that it hurts as that no one will take
you. I had a hole bored in me when I
was quite new, and a blue ribbon was
threaded through me, and I was hung
round a little girl’s neck. That was all
right, especially as we used to go to all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
kinds of places together, even to the pantomime
and “Peter Pan,” and from where I
used to hang I could see too; but one
day, in a crowd in London, a thief with a
pair of scissors cut the ribbon and pulled
me off, and I have never been happy since.
I have been in many persons’ possession,
but I see nothing of life, because I change
hands only at night. When it is light the
people won’t have me. They call out,
“Hi, this shilling won’t do!” and push
me back again. I can’t buy anything by
day at all, but at night I am slipped into
cabmen’s hands. It is very uncomfortable
for me, for not only am I condemned to a
kind of furtive, dishonest life, but I have to
hear the dreadful things the cabmen say
when they discover me.</p>

<p>“‘There is only one worse thing,’ he
went on, ‘and that is to be a bad shilling.
But there aren’t many of those made,
because it doesn’t pay to make false coins
so small. The coiners spend their time on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
bad half-crowns and florins, which cost
hardly any more to make than a shilling
and are worth ever so much more.’</p>

<p>“He went on to tell me of a bad half-crown
that he once knew which was now
nailed to the counter of a tobacconist’s in
Bermondsey. ‘Think of it,’ he said,
‘nailed to a counter. Never able to move
again: never able to buy another thing for
ever and ever!’ We both shuddered.</p>

<p>“Directly the car was in its garage the
chauffeur hurried to his lodgings and
changed his clothes and went out to enjoy
himself. It was now about half-past six.
He put his money into different pockets,
and I found myself with half a crown and
a florin. They were fairly sociable,
especially when they knew I had won
money at the races, but I had their
company only a very short time, for
suddenly I began to feel myself sinking.
I cried out for help, but all in vain; and
in a moment I fell with a rush and knew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
no more until I awoke to find myself in
the mud of the street.</p>

<p>“There was a hole in the pocket!</p>

<p>“I lay there for a long time in an agony
of fear that I should be run over. I heard
the beat of horses’ feet close to me and the
rumbling of wagons that shook the ground,
and now and then a motor-car dashed by
and turned me cold with fear. But as no
harm came to me I realized that I must
have fallen—I could not see for mud—very
near the gutter; perhaps quite in it.</p>

<p>“‘I do wish some one would pick me
up,’ I thought, ‘but I don’t see how they
can, for if I can’t see them for mud, they
can’t see me for mud.’ Just as I was
saying this to myself, I felt a great splash
on my face, and then another and another.
A shower, and a very heavy one, had
begun. In spite of the wet this made me
very happy, for I was gradually being
washed clean, and ‘now,’ thought I, ‘I
shall be seen.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>“It happened exactly as I guessed, for
almost immediately afterwards a hand
pounced down on me and picked me up,
and I heard a man’s voice say, ‘Well, I’m
blowed if it ain’t a bob!’ I almost screamed
as he put me between his teeth and bit
me. ‘And a good’un too,’ he added,
and then addressing the woman with him,
who was leading a little boy, he said:
‘Come on, old girl, and we’ll have some
dinner after all,’ and we all went off to the
nearest Lockhart’s refreshment-room and
sat down at a table by the fire.</p>

<p>“‘What shall it be, missis?’ the man
asked. ‘Two pots of splash for me and
you, and three doorsteps and a mug of
chalk for his nibs?’</p>

<p>“The woman said that would do nicely,
and the man went off to get the things
from the counter, and as he had to give
me in payment that was the last I saw of
him and his family; for which I was sorry,
for they were nice kindly sort of people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
although so poor. But I was able to see
what he meant by his strange words, for
he took back with him two cups of coffee,
and three thick slices of bread and butter,
and a mug of milk.</p>

<p>“Half an hour later I was given in
change to a jolly navvy who was having
an evening out with his girl. They had
finished their supper and were now on
their way to the circus. He held me in
his hand until we got to the gallery door,
and then I was pushed through a little
grating and once again flung into a crowded
till.</p>

<p>“There I felt I was doomed to stay for
some time, for it was late and no one else
was likely to come in. However, I did
not mind much, for I was very tired and
my head buzzed. ‘A shilling’s,’ I said to
myself, as I lay there, ‘is a very disappointing
life. Here am I lying in the till
of a circus ticket-office and seeing nothing,
while my late owner, who but for me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
would not be at the circus at all, is having
all the fun.’ Where I lay I could faintly
hear the band and the laughter. ‘But for
me,’ I continued, ‘why, but for me and
other coins people couldn’t do anything at
all. It is we who give them their power.
Just see what I have done this very day
since I got up—I have bought tickets and
food and drink and cab-rides for many
people; I have been put into the plate at
church and I have won ten shillings at the
races; I have given pleasure and profit;
I have fed the hungry; and I have just
sent two worthy persons into the gallery of
this circus. Not a bad day’s work!’</p>

<p>“So saying I composed myself to sleep,
but just at that moment one of the
managers came round to ask for some
change, and once again I was sent out into
the world. The manager put on his hat
and overcoat and started for home, giving
me for his ticket at the station, where I
passed out again as change to a gentleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
who was going to Notting Hill Gate, who
put me in his pocket and did not take me
out until he went to bed. And would you
believe it? when I looked round I found I
was on the very same dressing-table on
which I had awakened in the morning,
with my friend the silver-backed brush
beside me.</p>

<p>“‘Then he didn’t spend you to-day?’
said the hair-brush, as soon as the man
had gone to bed, and we could get a little
time to ourselves.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, didn’t he?’ I exclaimed. ‘Why,
I’ve been all over London, in all kinds of
pockets to-day. I’ll tell you all about it.’</p>

<p>“Which I did; so that you and the
hair-brush are now equally wise.”</p>

<p>And there the shilling’s story ended.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But did it ever occur to you before what
a traveller a coin can be, and that it is
quite possible to get again at night the
same coin you parted with in the morning?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE RING OF FORTITUDE</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Priscilla had been a very good girl
her mother allowed her as a special treat
to play with her jewel-case. Of course
Priscilla had to be very careful, which,
indeed, she was by nature, having for the
most part a place for everything, and everything
in its place. She used to sit on the
floor with the jewel-case before her, and
take the rings and brooches and pendants
and necklaces and bracelets and pins out
one by one, and hold them up to the light
and make them flash, and then put them
on. There were diamonds and pearls, and
a large opal in which you saw deep down
in its milky depths little glints of burning
crimson and dancing green. But of all
the jewels Priscilla liked best a turquoise-ring,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
which her mother had ceased to wear.
Priscilla would very much have liked this
ring for her own; but her mother did not
care for little girls to wear rings at all,
except—but that is what I am going to
tell you.</p>

<p>One day, soon after Priscilla was eleven,
she had a bad toothache. It grew no better
as the time went on, although she
rubbed the tooth with medicine which her
mother sent for; and afterwards she held
a clove in her mouth, according to the
advice of a charwoman who happened to
be working in the house that day; and
then lay down with a piece of brown
paper against her cheek, soaked in vinegar
and then peppered, according to the advice
of the cook; and later sat close to the fire
with the heat on the toothache side, according
to the advice of the housemaid; and
finally sponged her cheek with almost
boiling water, according to the advice of
the nurse. Nothing did the tooth any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
good. It ached most of the night, and
the next morning poor Priscilla, with very
red eyes, was led away to the dentist’s by
her nurse.</p>

<p>Of course directly she found herself on
the terrible doorstep waiting for the horrible
door to open, her toothache went away
absolutely; but none the less she had to
go into the waiting-room, and look at old
<i>Punches</i> and old <i>Illustrated London Newses</i>
for a long time until the dentist was ready,
while fresh people came in and sat down
with a sigh, including one old gentleman
with a left cheek like the glass of a bull’s-eye
lantern; and then Priscilla’s turn came
and she went upstairs and for half an hour
the dentist tortured her.</p>

<p>It was a tooth which, he said, must be
saved and not extracted, and so he got out
his little needles and his little looking-glass,
and was exceedingly cruel—although
by nature one of the kindest men living,
who would not wittingly hurt a fly except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
for its own good—as in the case of Priscilla.
And when the half-hour was
finished he had only just begun, and he
told her to come again in four days’ time
and he would try and finish it.</p>

<p>“Will it hurt again then?” Priscilla
asked.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it will,” said the dentist.</p>

<p>Poor Priscilla! The tooth went on
steadily grumbling with pain, and Priscilla’s
nerves were all upset, so that,
although she was naturally brave, she
could think of nothing but the next
dreadful time, and as it drew nearer and
nearer she broke down completely.</p>

<p>“I’m very sorry, mother,” she said,
“but I really don’t think I can,” and
so saying she burst into sobs.</p>

<p>“If you will get on your things and
come with me to the Stores,” said her
mother, “I think I can help you.”</p>

<p>Priscilla brightened at once. She liked
going to the Stores, not only because it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
was exciting to buy things and be among
so much to buy, but also because she was
always interested in the fat commissionaire
with the dog-chains at the top of the
steps, who knew all the dogs of Westminster
intimately.</p>

<p>When they got to the Stores, and Smike
had been chained up, Priscilla’s mother
led the way to the jewellery department,
and, singling out one of the assistants, she
said, “Is my ring done yet?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he; “it has just come
back.” And he took out of a drawer a
little box, and out of the box a ring,
and handed it to Priscilla’s mother. And
Priscilla’s mother handed it to Priscilla
and said, “See if it fits, dear.” And, behold!
it was the turquoise-ring she had
always loved so much, and, although it
was rather loose, it fitted well enough for
Priscilla to refuse to let the Stores have it
again to alter it. In this decision she was
supported by her mother, who said that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
it should come back again after a day or
two. And so the assistant gave Priscilla
the little box, and off they went home.</p>

<p>On their way Priscilla’s mother explained
to Priscilla the value of the ring.</p>

<p>“It is for you to wear,” she said, “only
when you feel you want some extra help
to enable you to bear up, as you do to-day.
Let us call it the ring of fortitude, and
every time you look down and see it, or
feel it on your finger, you will remember
what it means and why it is there, and
that will give you courage. Why, you
are much braver already.”</p>

<p>And it is true that Priscilla was. She
almost skipped along beside her mother,
and all that day she fondled the ring and
forgot all about her tooth and the dentist,
even about the perfectly hateful buzzing
thing that he drills holes with.</p>

<p>She had a good night, and went off to
him in the morning almost smiling, and
whether it was that the ring helped her not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
to feel, or whether the dentist really did
not hurt, I don’t know, but it is certain
that she had almost a pleasant sitting in his
detestable chair.</p>

<p>In addition to the ring of fortitude,
Priscilla had been given a shilling to buy
some cakes for tea from a little shop off
Regent Street that was famous in her
family for a certain kind of scone. The
dentist’s man called a cab, and she and her
nurse drove off very happily for the cakes
and then all down Regent Street and
through St. James’s Park home.</p>

<p>It was upon hearing her mother’s first
words, “Was the ring good to you?” that
Priscilla realized that she was no longer
wearing it!</p>

<p>Her heart stood still.</p>

<p>She searched her gloves and her clothes
and the bag with the cakes in it, and then
she searched them again; but to no
purpose.</p>

<p>Priscilla was the most miserable child in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
London. She would rather, she felt, have
forty toothaches.</p>

<p>Directly after lunch, which she had the
utmost difficulty in eating, she and her
mother hurried off to the confectioner’s to
see if the ring was there; but it was not.</p>

<p>Then they went off to Scotland Yard to
describe it to the police and see if the
cabman had by any chance found it and
taken it there.</p>

<p>The Lost Property Office at Scotland
Yard is divided into two parts, one for
umbrellas and the other for miscellaneous
things. Every day hundreds of persons
seem to make a point of leaving something
in a cab, and the doors of these
offices are swinging continuously to let the
losers in and out. A very nice policeman
took down the particulars of the ring—what
it was like, when and where Priscilla
remembered seeing it last, the time she got
into the cab and the time she left it, and
so forth. Then he told them that if it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
were brought in they should have a
letter.</p>

<p>But the letter did not come, and day
after day passed, and Priscilla grew so
tired of looking at cabmen in the hope of
seeing her own cabman again that she slept
badly and became pale and nervous, for
she dreamed every night of nothing but
hansoms, not only in the streets, but
indoors too, and even upstairs, driven by
men without faces at all. And they never
said anything to her, but just drove on and
on, never stopping to pick up passengers
or put them down. The world was full
of cabmen, cabmen, cabmen....</p>

<p>The doctor said that unless something
happened to divert her mind Priscilla
would be really ill.</p>

<p>But something did happen.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>One evening, nearly a fortnight later,
Priscilla’s father was sitting by the fire
reading a book he had bought at a book-stall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span> 
that afternoon. It was the life of an
actor named Charles Mayne Young, who
lived a hundred years ago, and it was full
of odd and interesting things. Suddenly
he said, “Listen to this,” and read to
Priscilla and her mother the following
story, which was told to Mr. Young’s son
by a Brighton magistrate after dinner on
Christmas Day, 1827:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Some few years ago, a gentleman, a
bachelor, residing in lodgings on the
first floor of a respectable but small
house in this town, appeared before the
bench of magistrates with a charge
against the maid of his lodging of having
robbed him of a ring.</p>

<p>“It appeared that he occupied the
front drawing-room on the first floor
and slept in the back; that one night,
having undressed by the drawing-room
fire and wound up his watch, he deposited
it, with his chain, two seals, and
a ring attached to it, on the chimney-piece,
and jumped into bed in the next
room. In the morning, on dressing
himself and going to the chimney-piece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
for his watch, he discovered that the
ring, which he valued, was gone. As
he was in the habit of sleeping with the
folding-doors between the rooms ajar,
and was always a light sleeper, he felt
confident that no one had entered the
room since he had left it overnight
except the maid, who had come in
early, as usual, to dust and sweep the
room and lay the table for breakfast.
The servant was so neat in her person,
so pretty, gentle, and well conducted,
that he felt loath to tell her his suspicions;
but the moral certainty he entertained of
her guilt, and the great value he set on
the ring, determined him to conquer his
scruples. On hearing herself charged
with the theft, she started and stared, as
if doubting the evidence of her ears,
indignantly denied the charge, burst
into tears, and told her mistress that she
would not remain another hour under
her roof, for that her lodger had taxed
her with dishonesty. The landlady
espoused the cause of her maid, and
used such strong language against her
accuser, that his blood in turn was
roused, and he resolved to bring the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
matter to a determinate issue before the
magistrates. My friend said he was on
the bench, and that, prepossessed as he
and his coadjutors were by the girl’s
looks and manners, they felt quite unable
to resist the weight of circumstantial
evidence produced against her, and never
had a moment’s hesitation in committing
her for trial at the next assizes.</p>

<p>“Five or six weeks after she had been
in jail the prosecutor went into Shaw’s,
the pastry-cook’s in the Old Steyne, for
an ice. While he was pausing deliberately
between each spoonful, the sun
burst forth in all its strength, and darted
one of its beams along the floor of the
shop, bringing into light an object which
glistened vividly between the joists of
the flooring. He took out his penknife,
inserted the point of it between the
boards, and, to his utter amazement,
fished up his lost ring. He ran back
to his lodgings, and, on referring to his
diary, he found that, on the evening of
the very night on which he had left his
watch and its appendages on the chimney-piece,
he had been at Shaw’s having
some refreshment; and he conjectured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
that, as half the split ring from which
his seals hung had been for some time a
good deal wrenched apart, it must have
come into contact with the edge of the
counter, and thus liberated the ring from
its hold; that it had fallen on the
ground, been trodden under the feet of
some of the visitors to the shop, and in
this way been wedged in between the
boards of the flooring. Stung to the
quick by self-reproach, at the thought
of having tarnished the good name of an
innocent girl by false accusation, and of
having exposed her to the unmerited
sufferings of prison life, he instantly took
a post-chaise and drove off to the jail in
which she was confined, asked every
particular about her from the governor,
and found him enthusiastic in his admiration
of her, and utterly incredulous of
her guilt. ‘She’s the gentlest, sweetest-tempered
creature we have ever had
within these walls, and nothing shall
make me believe she is a thief,’ said he.
‘No more she is,’ was the eager answer.
‘She has been falsely charged by me,
and I have come to make her every
reparation in my power.’ In one brief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
word, he offered her his hand, and
married her.”</p>
</div>

<p>“There!” said Priscilla’s father, when
he had finished. “Why shouldn’t our
ring have fallen into a crack at the pastry-cook’s
in just the same way? You say it
was a little bit loose, and Priscilla remembers
taking off her glove in the shop.
It’s an old shop, isn’t it?” he added.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Priscilla’s mother, “very
old.”</p>

<p>“Then very likely there are wide cracks
in the floor, or even holes?”</p>

<p>“Quite likely,” said Priscilla’s mother.</p>

<p>“Then I think I’ll go at once and see.”
Priscilla’s father was very impulsive, and
when he thought of a thing he liked to
do it.</p>

<p>“Oh, father, may I come too?” cried
Priscilla.</p>

<p>“It will make you so late for bed,” said
her father.</p>

<p>“Only this once,” Priscilla urged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“And the shop will be shut,” said her
mother.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll get them to let me in!” said
her father.</p>

<p>“Do let me go, do!” said Priscilla. “I
may, mayn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said her father; “but you
must wrap up very warm.”</p>

<p>So Priscilla’s father filled his pipe, and
Maggie stood on the steps and blew twice,
and soon a cab came, and off they bowled
to the little street off Regent Street.</p>

<p>Priscilla’s mother was quite right. The
shop was shut; but Priscilla’s father hammered
on the side door, and soon it was
opened by a very little servant in a cap
all on one side.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Dear in?” asked Priscilla’s
father.</p>

<p>“No, he’s not,” said the very little
servant.</p>

<p>“Is Mrs. Dear in?” asked Priscilla’s
father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>“There isn’t a Mrs. Dear,” said the very
little servant.</p>

<p>“Then who is there?” asked Priscilla’s
father.</p>

<p>“There’s Miss Dear,” said the very little
servant. “Mrs. Dear died years ago, on
the day after the Diamond Jubilee.”</p>

<p>“Is Miss Dear in?” asked Priscilla’s
father.</p>

<p>“No; Mr. Dear and Miss Dear have
both gone to Maskelyne and Devant’s,”
said the very little servant, with a husky
note in her voice that suggested she
wished she was there too. “They have
free seats,” she added, quite unnecessarily,
“for putting the bill in the window.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s no one at home but
you?” said Priscilla’s father.</p>

<p>“Only the bakers,” said the very little
servant, “but they’re busy at the back.”</p>

<p>“May I go into the shop for a minute?”
said Priscilla’s father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_255_facing">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_255_facing.jpg" alt="WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT MR. DEAR IS LIKE?">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">“WILL YOU TELL ME WHAT MR. DEAR IS LIKE?”</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>“No, you mayn’t,” said the very little
servant very decidedly, half closing the
door as she spoke, and Priscilla’s father
saw at once that it would be quite useless
to try and get her to believe that he was
not a thief.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said; “don’t be
frightened. But will you tell me what
Mr. Dear is like, because I am going to
Maskelyne and Devant’s to try and find
him.”</p>

<p>The very little servant, keeping the door
nearly shut and speaking through the
crack, was willing to sketch her master
and mistress. Mr. Dear, she said, had
white whiskers on each cheek and a pair
of perfectly round spectacles. (“Like
an owl,” Priscilla thought.) And Miss
Dear was wearing a hat with about half a
pint of cherries on it, she should think.
And they would be in the balcony.</p>

<p>So off went Priscilla and her father to
Maskelyne and Devant’s, and they had no
difficulty in distinguishing Mr. and Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
Dear, but as the performance was going
on, it was some time before there was an
interval in which they could be approached.
Priscilla did not mind that at
all, for the most wonderful things were
happening on the stage, where people
were appearing and disappearing at the
word of command, and, no matter how
carefully you watched them, the conjuror
always turned out to be somebody
else. And there was a Japanese juggler
who climbed up a pole that was balanced
on another Japanese juggler’s shoulder.</p>

<p>When the interval came at last—all too
soon—Priscilla’s father squeezed along the
seats and introduced himself to Mr. Dear,
and Priscilla saw them talking very
intently, and now and then they looked at
her, and then her father beckoned to her
to come, and she squeezed along too, and
Mr. Dear and Miss Dear made room for
her, and they all sat together for the rest
of the performance, and Miss Dear offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
a bag of sweets from time to time,
with</p>

<p class="center">O. W. DEAR,<br>
<span class="smcap">Pastrycook and Confectioner</span>,</p>

<p>printed on it. And all the time, no
matter what was happening on the stage,
Miss Dear was saying, “Well, there!”
“Oh, dad, did you see that!” “Well I
never!” And once, when Mr. Devant
drew a rabbit out of a gentleman’s collar,
she cried, “Oh, actuality!”</p>

<p>And then “God save the King” was
played, and they all trooped out into
Regent Street, and Miss Dear and Priscilla
followed Mr. Dear and Priscilla’s
father (who were talking about the Government)
down to the shop. When the
very little servant saw them all together
her eyes grew twice as big as before. But
her master told her to get them the key
of the shop quickly, and while she was
gone they all stood there in the narrow
passage, surrounded by the smell of new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
bread. Then Mr. Dear unlocked the
door into the shop, and lit the gas, and
then he fetched a candle, and Priscilla
showed them where she was standing
when she bought the cakes, and her father
and Mr. Dear went down on their hands
and knees and groped about very carefully,
moving only a very few inches at a time.</p>

<p>“What about this hole?” said Priscilla’s
father at last.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Dear, “it is rather a
big one. Can you see anything shine?”</p>

<p>Priscilla’s father screwed his head down
and twisted every way, while he held
the candle so as to throw light into the
blackness.</p>

<p>“No, I can’t,” he said. “But how about
opening it up?”</p>

<p>“Lizzie,” said Mr. Dear to his daughter,
“run and get a hammer.”</p>

<p>Miss Dear hurried off.</p>

<p>“And you, little Missie,” said Mr.
Dear to Priscilla, “you lift down that jar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
at the end of the second row, and you’ll
find something nice to go on with while
we’re busy.”</p>

<p>Priscilla found the jar and opened it,
and it was full of chocolates with “hundreds
and thousands” sprinkled on the top.</p>

<p>When Miss Dear returned with the
hammer and the very little servant, Mr.
Dear began to wrench up the board. It
was very rotten, and came away easily,
leaving plenty of room for his hand to
grope about. Mr. Dear dipped into the
black dust several times, and placed a heap
on the floor each time, until the place was
empty.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, “what shall we find?”
And, placing the two candles close to the
heap of dirt, he began to examine it, while
Priscilla’s father and Priscilla and Miss
Dear and the very little servant all crouched
down on the floor and looked on. Priscilla’s
heart beat like a motor-car standing
still.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>“Bless my soul,” said Mr. Dear suddenly,
“if here isn’t half a sovereign?”</p>

<p>“Fancy that!” said Miss Dear.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Priscilla’s father, “and here’s
a halfpenny.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” said Miss Dear.</p>

<p>“Pins,” said Mr. Dear, “by the hundred.”</p>

<p>“And here’s a pencil,” said Priscilla’s
father.</p>

<p>“And—yes—no—yes—if it isn’t a
ring?” cried Mr. Dear, holding something
up.</p>

<p>“Oh, actuality!” said Miss Dear.</p>

<p>Priscilla seized it with a gasp of joy.
“It is!” she exclaimed. “Yes, it is.”</p>

<p>It was the ring. Priscilla rubbed it
clean, and the gold was as golden as ever,
and the turquoise had the same darling
blue.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Dear, “if that isn’t
the queerest go?”</p>

<p>Priscilla was so happy she nearly cried,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
and Miss Dear kissed Priscilla, and kissed
dad, and the very little servant jumped
about, and Mr. Dear kissed Miss Dear,
and kissed Priscilla, and wrung Priscilla’s
father’s hand. They both said, “What
an extraordinary coincidence!” And Priscilla’s
father promised Mr. Dear a copy of
the book as soon as he could get one, and
Mr. Dear said it ought to be in the <i>Daily
Mail</i>.</p>

<p>And then Priscilla and her father said
“Good-night” and “Thank you” several
times, and at last got away and hurried
home to relieve the mind of Priscilla’s
mother, who, as you may suppose, was
wondering what had become of them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That is only one story of the ring of
fortitude. There are several others, which
I may tell you at another time—how it
comforted Priscilla in other times of need,
and gave her strength, and how now and
then she lent it to others, and it helped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
them too. But if you are inclined to
doubt such a strange coincidence as I have
related, you have only to go into Mr.
Dear’s shop—O. W. Dear, Pastrycook
and Confectioner—and just mention the
topic of a lost ring, and he will not only
tell you the whole story from beginning
to end, but show you the Life of Young,
and also the crack in the floor; and Miss
Dear will bear him out.</p>

<p>But don’t forget to buy a teacake, for
he makes the best in London.</p>

<p>“Mr. E. V. Lucas has a sure knowledge of the way to
please a child. ‘Anne’s Terrible Good Nature’ is as good
a set of short stories for children as could be made.”—<i>Nation.</i></p>

<p>“All Mr. E. V. Lucas’s books for children are delightful....
In ‘Anne’s Terrible Good Nature’ he is fantastical and
suggestive, and often full of information for childish minds—and
he is always very sympathetic.”—<i>Queen.</i></p>

<p>“A volume of capital stories for children. In fact, they
are so pleasantly written that grown-ups can read them
with equal interest. Mr. Lucas’s touch is so light and his
humour so easy, indeed, that whatever he writes makes
agreeable reading.... Many stories, all of which are
good.”—<i>Westminster Gazette.</i></p>

<p>“I have read every word of every story, and enjoyed each
word of each.”—<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>“We recommend with every confidence to ladies and
gentlemen between the ages of seven and fourteen this
volume of short stories.... About all his plots there is a
glowing consciousness of the deliciousness of doing good
things to please other people.”—<i>Tablet.</i></p>

<p>“The name of the author is almost a guarantee for the
quality of the tales. These are delightfully written, and
make the most wholesome of reading for young folks.”—<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>“It is a delightful book for children.”—<i>Nottingham
Guardian.</i></p>

<p>“There is not a word in this book which a child would not
understand, and the incidents follow each other as a child
desires that they should, making clear tales with such plots
as children love.”—<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

<p>“Sly or jovial fun, tenderness, boyishness, knowledge of
children—all sorts of things which are quite impossible to
resist. And there are Mr. A. H. Buckland’s pictures, too.”—<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>“Really good, useful, and amusing stories for children.”—<i>School
Guardian.</i></p>
